It's almost time for this year's leg of the MTV Base VJ Search, and auditions are scheduled to kick off later this month in a city near you. Every year, the competition opens doors for an upcoming performer who walks away with their dream job as a presenter on the channel. The winner receives a 12-month contract, during which they stand a chance to host MTV Base shows, interview celebrities, MC events, attend international awards shows, walk the red carpet and travel the continent â€” all while being an ambassador for the channel. They, too, will become household names, following in the footsteps of previous winners: Sizwe Dhlomo, DJ Fix, Nomuzi Mabena, Sandile Ntshingila and Tshego Mosupye, who won the competition last year. Here's where and when you can audition: July 21: Olive Convention Centre, Durban July 28: Castle of Good Hope, Cape Town August 4: East London Golf Club, East London August 18: Zone 6 Venue, Soweto, Johannesburg Auditions start at 9am and are open until 4pm in each city. You need not register, just arrive at the venue and bring your most colourful self.
