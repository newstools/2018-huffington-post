  Every month, we round up the 10 most-liked recipes from the HuffPost Taste Instagram account. Our lists have been dominated by comfort foods and chocolatey desserts of late, but we're finally starting to see a shift as the northern hemisphere summer turns into a scorcher. Warmer weather in the U.S. has made Instagrammers begin to crave avocado salads, vegetable-packed summer minestrones, towering wedge salads and Neapolitan ice cream pops. Naturally, there are still some pancakes, doughnuts and breakfast grilled cheeses in the mix; deliciousness still comes in hot and cold. Check out the 10 most-liked foods from June below, and then go follow HuffPost Taste on Instagram.
