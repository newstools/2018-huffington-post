  When anything less than ***Flawless happens in the life of Beyoncé, the world takes notice. So, of course, a stage malfunction had the BeyHive buzzing. After releasing their joint album, "Everything Is Love", Bey and husband Jay-Z have been watching crowds go apes**t on the On the Run II tour, but she experienced a minor hiccup at the Warsaw, Poland, stop on Saturday night. At the tail end of the concert, Bey was essentially stranded on a flying stage six or so metres in the air; one that serves as the show's closing stunt to allow her to bid fans — even those in the cheap seats — adieu. When it became clear the aerial platform was stuck during the couple's performance of "Young Forever" and "Perfect", a team of stagehands quickly came to her rescue with an emergency ladder so that she could get down safely. Of course, the entire incident was captured by fans in the audience who began chanting her name as she decided how exactly she was going to descend from the stage, especially while wearing a spangled bodysuit and high heels. After some deliberation, Bey finally managed to make her way down, but not before treating the patient fans to a little dance move and even blowing them kisses. The Carters recently completed the U.K. leg of their tour and are now making their way through the rest of Europe, before kicking off a string of U.S.-based shows later in July. The power couple are expected to rake in more than $200-million (~R2.73-billion) over the course of the tour ― more than double the gross of their 2014 outing ― likely owing to increased ticket prices and renewed interest in their decades-long romance.
