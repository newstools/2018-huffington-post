Mark Wahlberg brought out a six-pack on Monday to celebrate the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers signing LeBron James. The 47-year-old "Transformers" star showed off his physique regularly as a Calvin Klein underwear model back in the day. And decades later he still goes shirtless on social media, even getting grilled by Ellen DeGeneres about his stripped-down selfies. Now it seems the occasion of James' arrival in Hollywood has inspired more torso-baring on Instagram. Somebody has been doing his planks and crunches. We know, we know â€• Wahlberg is a Massachusetts guy and a big Boston Celtics fan. So why would he be so thrilled about James that he would strike a pose? He explained that James' departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers would make it easier for the Celtics to dominate the Eastern Conference. (Boston lost to Cleveland in the conference final this year.)
