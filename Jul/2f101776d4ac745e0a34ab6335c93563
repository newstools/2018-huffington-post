The late celebrity chef and adventurer Anthony Bourdain has bequeathed most of his estate to his 11-year-old daughter Ariane, according to news outlets. Citing papers filed on Thursday in the Manhattan Surrogate's Court, the New York Daily News reported that Bourdain ― the host of CNN's "Parts Unknown", who died by suicide last month at age 61 ― had holdings that included $425,000 in savings and cash, $500,000 in "intangible property including royalties and residuals", $250,000 in personal property and $35,000 in a brokerage account. Some outlets put the value of his estate at $1.2-million, but the filing also noted a $1-million mortgage on an unspecified property ― possibly a Manhattan condo that Bourdain bought in 2014, the New York Post reported. The court will choose a guardian of the estate to safekeep Ariane's inheritance until she is of age, according to the documents. Bourdain left his estranged wife and the will's executor, Ottavia Busia-Bourdain, his "personal and household effects ... to dispose of in accordance with what (she) believes to have been my wishes," the two papers reported. Bourdain was found dead in a Kaysersberg, France, hotel room on June 8 while on location for a segment of "Parts Unknown".
