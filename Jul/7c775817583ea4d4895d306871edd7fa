If you're an introvert, you likely value your alone time. You think before you speak. You'd much rather socialize one-on-one than in a group. A phone call is probably your worst nightmare. But most of all, you are silently strong. It can be tough to prefer to be alone in a world that values boldness and extroversion. But take heart, quiet types: Twitter has your back. Each month we round up spot-on tweets that capture what it's like to be an introvert. Scroll down for our latest batch. After paying my pizza delivery guy

Pizza Guy: "Thanks, have a good meal!"

Me: "You too!"
*Realizes awkward mistake*
Me: "Because... I'm inviting you to eat with me! Come in!"

Pizza Guy: "Uhhh... that's okay..."#AwkwardIntrovert#IntrovertLife#IntrovertProblems#Introvert You know things are serious when the introverts arrive. ðŸ˜‰

- Constantly looking at my watch
- Responses limited to "uh huh"
- Gradual steps backwards
- Endless yawning
- Looking behind me
- Faking a cough
- Checking my phone for the time
