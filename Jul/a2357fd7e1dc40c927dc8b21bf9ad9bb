Prince Harry, Meghan Markle (now the Duchess of Sussex), as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, stepped out together just one day after they all showed up to two-month-old Prince Louis’ christening. The royal fab four made an appearance at the 100th birthday celebrations of the Royal Air Force at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. Prince Harry and his brother Prince William both wore full RAF uniforms to the event, while Duchess Kate wore an Alexander McQueen number for the second day in a row, according to People. She paired the look with a gorgeous brooch, a matching Sean Barrett hat and nude heels. The Duchess of Sussex looked stunning in a demure, belted dress from Dior with her favored boatneck neckline and a wild, Stephen Jones fascinator that she makes look chic. Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Queen Elizabeth II also attended the event at Westminster. After the service at the Abbey, the royals went to Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of aircraft to mark the centenary celebrations. Prince Louis, born April 23, is the youngest child of Prince William and the former Kate Middleton. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were notably absent from the prince’s christening at St. James’s Palace on Monday. Buckingham Palace told the Press Association in a statement that the two had previously agreed to skip the christening, and their absence wasn’t related to health problems. Unfortunately, that means they also missed out on the 7-year-old cake the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge served at a reception at Clarence House following the christening. Per British royal tradition, Prince William and Duchess Kate saved tiers from their wedding cake and served it at all three children’s christenings. Sounds... delicious.
