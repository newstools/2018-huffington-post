President Donald Trump used to taunt North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as "Little Rocket Man" for his frequent missile tests. Now, as relations between the two thaw, Trump is sending Kim a gift: an Elton John CD with the song "Rocket Man" on it, signed by the president himself. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in Pyongyang for a meeting with Kim, is bringing a letter from Trump and the CD. Citing a diplomatic source in Washington, the newspaper said Kim mentioned the derogative nickname to Trump during their meeting in Singapore last month. Trump asked if he knew the song, and Kim replied that he didn't. Now, he'll be able to hear the tune, and maybe return the favour with a mix tape. Pompeo said he plans to discuss denuclearisation as a follow-up to an agreement signed by Trump and Kim during their meeting last month. "On this trip, I'm seeking to fill in some details on those commitments and continue the momentum toward implementation of what the two leaders promised each other and the world," said Pompeo in a statement cited by CBS News. "I expect that [North Korea] is ready to do the same." Share this slide:
