That's no ordinary cosplayer: That's Wonder Woman herself. Gal Gadot, dressed as the comic character she plays in blockbuster movies, made a superheroic appearance at Inova Children's Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, recently. Gadot, 33, is filming the "Wonder Woman" sequel "Wonder Woman 1984" nearby, in and around Washington, D.C. Her drop-by appeared to thrill patients, staff and parents. This beats boffo box office any day. One woman, Kelly Swink Sahady, thanked the actress for spending time with her daughter Karalyne, a leukemia patient who's awaiting a bone marrow transplant, according to her GoFundMe page. "We're fans for life now," Sahady said in a video. "You are a true Wonder Woman," Dr. Lucas Collazo wrote on Twitter. Check out other pics of Gadot, er, Wonder Woman in action.
