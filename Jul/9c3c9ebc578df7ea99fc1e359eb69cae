Blessed be the 2018 Emmy nominations. “The Handmaid’s Tale” star Samira Wiley and “The Blacklist” actor Ryan Eggold jointly announced the nominees for the the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, which will take place on Sept. 17 on NBC, from the Wolf Theatre at Saban Media Center Television Academy on Thursday morning. This year “Saturday Night Live” “Weekend Update” co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che will be taking over hosting duties from Stephen Colbert, becoming the first cast members to do so since Eddie Murphy in 1983. HBO’s fantasy juggernaut “Game Of Thrones” led the pack with 22 nominations after the series was ineligible to compete in 2017 due to a delayed premiere date. “Saturday Night Live” and “Westworld” trailed not too far behind, netting 21 nods each. “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which was the big winner at last year’s ceremony, was once again represented in the major categories, including Best Drama Series, Lead Actress, Supporting Actress and more. While HBO was certainly not lacking for any awards attention, Netflix, for the first year ever, bested the cable giant, scoring an impressive 112 nominations. Newcomers like BBC’s “Killing Eve,” HBO’s “Barry” and Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” are all up for awards following debut seasons that have already garnered tremendous buzz. And returning favorites like the Donald Glover-helmed “Atlanta” and NBC’s tearjerker “This Is Us” also got some Emmys love, picking up a respective 16 and 8 nominations.
