Justin Bieber reportedly got engaged to girlfriend Hailey Baldwin this weekend. The “Baby” singer proposed to the model in the Bahamas on Saturday, TMZ first reported. Bieber, 24, and Baldwin, 21, briefly dated in 2015 and 2016 and rekindled their romance about a month ago. People also reported the news, citing an unidentified source, as did US Weekly, citing a source close to Baldwin. Bieber and Baldwin were at a resort’s restaurant when two eyewitnesses said they saw Bieber get down on one knee, according to TMZ. Baldwin’s father, actor Stephen Baldwin, appeared to all but to confirm the engagement in a tweet Sunday that he later deleted. It included the couple’s initials, a Bible verse about husbands loving their wives and the hashtag #bestisyettocome. The post also included the Twitter handles of Bieber’s parents, Jeremy Bieber and Pattie Mallette. He didn’t indicate why he later removed the tweet.

It was a sudden decision but Justin always knew Hailey and him had a special bond that was incomparable,” the source said. “The proposal was a very happy moment and Hailey was taken off guard. ... Her face was in shock but you could tell they are both so in love.” Bieber’s dad appeared to respond to the news on social media, posting a photo of his son on Instagram with a caption that read: “Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter!” He also tweeted: “The proudest.” A post shared by Jeremy Bieber (@jeremybieber) on Jul 8, 2018 at 8:31am PDT Mallette tweeted Saturday: “Love Love Love Love Love Love Love.” Bieber and Baldwin have recently spent time together in Canada, New York City and the Hamptons on Long Island, New York, where they were photographed kissing and holding hands. Baldwin was previously linked to singer Shawn Mendez, and Bieber intermittently dated singer Selena Gomez for years before calling it quits again this spring.
