LeBron James is leaving Cleveland again ― but not without a classy online farewell. The NBA superstar posted a heartfelt message on Instagram on Sunday, after his agency announced that he was signing a four-year, $154-million (~R2.14-billion) contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. James' second go-around with his home-state Cavaliers resulted in four appearances in the NBA Finals and one championship ― a comeback from a 3 games to 1 deficit to defeat the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Northeast Ohio's loss, however, is most definitely Hollywood's gain. Check out some of the stars welcoming King James to Tinseltown.   Share this slide:
