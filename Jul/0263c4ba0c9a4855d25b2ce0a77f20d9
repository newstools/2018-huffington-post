In surveying all that 2018 has given and taken from us so far, at least one patch of blue sky hangs overhead: it has been a dynamite year for movies. This list of the best includes every genre and mode of filmmaking. It has blockbusters, a rollicking comedy, a documentary, an avant-garde race satire, a few horror and sci-fi thrill rides, melancholy indies and lots of horses. (Truly. So many horses!) July is as good a time as any to take stock of the must-see gems that have graced our screens, a few of which could still have legs come Oscar season. If life is as alarming in the second half of the year as it was in the first, at least we have these respites to help us escape the horrific headlines. Spanning January through to the first week of July, these are some of the favourite movies so far.
