  England defeated Colombia in a heart-stopping penalty shootout last night, advancing to the World Cup quarter-finals. Here's how the match unfolded on social media: Excellent start from England. Dominant, confident and calm. me, 2002-2016: why can't we just keep the ball like the top European sides

me, 2018: NOT THERE, KYLE, FUCKING GET RID This ref is trash üöÆ bottled the red for a head butt and draws a line with the vanishing spray before he's got the wall back 10 yards. We're in for a long night here, comrades You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to work out that was a red card #ENGCOL#COLENGpic.twitter.com/5CR0aZdIl6 Captain Harry Kane you are simply the best!

Number 17, Johan Mojica, trying to sabotage the spot ahead of Kane's kick. pic.twitter.com/jX6fiV0jvP Because Colombia are playing a bit rough my mum says 'I'm not buying any more of their sausages'.

My dad corrected her.

You don't buy Colombian sausages you buy CUMBERLAND sausages.
