The 32-year-old "Big Bang Theory" star was previously married to tennis player Ryan Sweeting. Her divorce from him after 21 months of marriage was finalised in May 2016. "I honestly thought I wouldn't get married again," Cuoco said in last month's issue of Cosmopolitan. "My ex ruined that word for me. I married someone the first time who completely changed." "I knew I just had to be patient," she continued. "I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl." Cook, 27, shared a photograph from their nuptials on Sunday after what he called "the greatest night of my life marrying the love of my life!"
