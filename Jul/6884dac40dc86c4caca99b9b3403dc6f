Imagine looking over your shoulder while taking part in the parents' race at a school sports day, only to see David Beckham about to overtake you. School sports days bring out the competitive side in many of us, and we imagine competing against a professional footballer (albeit a retired one), rather ups the ante. But Beckham certainly wasn't going to make any allowances when taking on other dads in a beanbag-balancing race. Victoria Beckham shared a video of the competition in an Instastory to mark their 19th wedding anniversary. The Beckhams took time out from their romantic celebrations on July 4 to join Harper and her school friends at their sports day, and if anything it seems to have only made the day even more special.
