Comedian George Lopez resorted to a stream of consciousness instead of stand-up to protest Donald Trump. TMZ on Wednesday posted a cellphone video of the former sitcom actor pretending to pee on Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star with a water bottle. Lopez was reportedly booed at a charity event in October for making anti-Trump jokes. But observers heard in this video seem to get a laugh out of Lopez's stunt. Trump's star was a target for activists even before he became president. One man took a pickaxe to it in October 2016. But a little water won't hurt it. And now Lopez can say he has his own pee tape.
