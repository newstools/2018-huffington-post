A heatwave brought scorching weather to the U.K. last week, with temperatures soaring higher than 30ºC in some parts of the country — and it wasn't just the humans feeling like they were melting. The nation's pets have been finding cute, ingenious and hilarious ways to stay cool. We're particularly enjoying this photo Neil Harman shared on Twitter, showing his cat sitting in the sink to avoid the hot Plymouth sun. Here are some other animals who've got us feeling warm and fuzzy inside. An adorable snow leopard cub who was born with splayed legs is undergoing intensive physical therapy to help him learn how to walk. This week, Sacramento Zoo in California shared photos of the six-week-old cub taking his first steps using a special harness. Cute! Poncho, a Madrid police dog, became an internet sensation after a video showing him apparently performing CPR on his handler went viral. But the eight-year-old cocker spaniel doesn't perform CPR in real life, Spanish police said. His performance was just a fun way to explain to children how first aid can save lives. Last weekend Twycross Zoo, in Leicestershire, England, celebrated the tallest living terrestrial animals with two days dedicated to giraffes. As well as giraffe-themed games and talks, visitors had the chance to get up close and personal with the mammals during a feeding session. We're very jealous. Four endangered Amur tiger cubs were been born at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, England last week, with zookeepers capturing their first moments on hidden cameras. The cubs were born to seven-year-old Amur tigress Naya, on Saturday 23 June. Team leader Donovan Glyn said: "It's incredible news for us to have endangered Amur tiger cubs born here at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, but to have four of them is just amazing, especially when you consider there are only 500 left in the wild."
