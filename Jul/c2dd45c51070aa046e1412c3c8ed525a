  The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle packed a variety of chic, sleek outfits for her royal visit to Dublin with Prince Harry. But one suit in particular will look familiar to die-hard fans of the British royals. On Wednesday, the duchess wore a glamorous black pantsuit from Givenchy ― the same fashion label that made her wedding dress ― on a visit to Croke Park in Ireland. She paired the look with a cream shirt underneath, Sarah Flint heels (according to People) and minimal jewellery. The former "Suits" actress appeared to carry a R26,000 Givenchy GV3 bag. Not only is the look one that Rachel Zane ― her character from "Suits" ― would wear, it's similar to the Alexander McQueen suit she wore back in the Endeavour Fund Awards back in February. Though with that particular suit, the duchess wore a cream bodysuit from Tuxe with a pussy-bow collar. Meghan's carefully refined style ― which is seemingly getting more chic with each appearance ― ensured that fans in Ireland got a glimpse of designer labels, tailored dresses and fun accessories.
