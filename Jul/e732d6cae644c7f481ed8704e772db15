Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin found themselves in a bit of a traffic jam on Monday. The duo's Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG apparently broke down in the middle of the road as they were driving around the upmarket Hamptons ‚Äî a series of villages on Long Island, New York where many wealthy Americans keep holiday beach homes. Police were called to direct traffic until a mechanic could fetch the faulty vehicle, according to People. But in the meantime, Bieber intervened. Check out this incredible video of the "Sorry" crooner directing cars: A post shared by Justin Bieber//Selena Gomezü•Ä‚ù§Ô∏è (@jelena.turnt) on Jul 2, 2018 at 2:04pm PDT The video is so good for so many reasons. There are Bieber's hair and his white tank top. And there's Baldwin's incredulousness at the whole situation. If there were Peabody Awards for Instagram videos, this might get one. Bieber and Baldwin have been gallivanting around together for a hot minute now, suggesting that Bieber is over Selena, and that Baldwin is over Shawn Mendes. Now, maybe these two can find something besides car trouble to do with themselves. Share this slide:
