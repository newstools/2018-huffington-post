Top designers Quiteria & George have landed a new deal with a champagne brand. The pair was extremely evasive about the matter, but said they would make a formal announcement soon. "There is also the big collaboration with a champagne brand. I won't say much, but you will find out in the not-too-distant future," George told HuffPost in an interview on Thursday. The haute couture designers mentioned that they would be looking at doing more international gigs. "In the future, we would like to do the Met Gala," George said. The pair recently showed their elaborate gowns at Senagal's 16th Dakar Fashion Week, which was held at the Radisson Blu Hotel.
