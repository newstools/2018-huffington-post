Sony are developing a film about plus-size superhero Faith Herbert, it has been revealed. The Valiant Comics character will be brought to the big screen for the first time, as part of a deal Sony signed with the publisher in 2015. Deadline reports that Maria Melnik, writer on "American Gods", will pen the movie and the hunt is on for a lead star. The Hollywood publication has also revealed that two producers have been assigned to the project. Faith - whose alter-ego is Zephyr - has telekinetic powers and made her comic book debut in 1992, as part of the Harbinger team. Sony is gearing up for the release of another superhero film at the moment, as Tom Hardy makes his debut as Venom in October. Elsewhere, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going from strength to strength, with "Black Panther" and "Avengers: Infinity War" breaking numerous records on release this year. Share this slide:
