Vive Les Bleus! France were crowned 2018 World Cup champions on Sunday, after they beat Croatia in an enthralling 4-2 encounter in Moscow at the Luzhniki Stadium, winning their second world title. Their manager, Didier Deschamps, became only the third man in history to win the World Cup both as a player (1998) and as a manager, as he led his young but talented side to glory. France's victory, however, can also be acknowledged as a victory for the African continent â€” more than half the squad have African connections. According to The South African, 14 of France's 23-man squad are of African descent and could have chosen to play for the African continent, but choose to represent the European giants instead.
