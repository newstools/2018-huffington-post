Allez les Bleus! Vive la France! France defeated Croatia 4-2 in Sunday’s final match, winning the country’s second World Cup title. The nation’s first World Cup title came in 1998, when France’s squad defeated Brazil 3-0 at home in Paris. France lost a chance at a second title during the 2006 World Cup against Italy in a shootout.
