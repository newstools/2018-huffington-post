English football fans made their mark on the World Cup in Russia with the slogan "It's coming home" — a dream that Croatia dashed on Wednesday night.  The hype that affected England and their fans all over the world until the Three Lions crashed out of the tournament seems innocent enough — but in reality, English football fans are famous for their terrible behaviour around the world. Wednesday night's match between England and Croatia went down fairly peacefully. But while English fans are by no means the only hooligans in town, their reputation for violence has preceded them. From domestic violence and banning orders to damage to property and offending foreign nations, here are eight ways that English fans are the worst: "We at the British embassy in the UAE have been enjoying this year's World Cup, particularly the fantastic run that the England team are enjoying. Wherever you're enjoying the football, ensure that you are aware of and respecting the local laws and customs." Police in Dubai were reportedly investigating the video, and the man who danced naked reportedly fled the country. But English fans took it personally, interpreting the tweet as a dig at their country's decision to leave the E.U. According to the Daily Mail, fans responded with comments like: 'Absolutely pathetic — you are the lowest of the low,' 'This is one way to alienate pro European British people like me — you are a disgrace.' 'A disgraceful tweet that absolutely epitomises why the U.K. is leaving the E.U." 'You deserve credit for exemplifying the sheer arrogance of unelected bureaucrats so well!' 'Class is something you are born with. Is it any wonder most Brits voted to say goodbye to the E.U. with people like you helping to run it and showing absolutely no class whatsoever.'
