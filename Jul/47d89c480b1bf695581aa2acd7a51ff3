Things will get hairy between Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin if he attempts to bring back a former look on their wedding day. On Monday, the 24-year-old pop star confirmed his engagement to his model fiancée in a gushy Instagram post, but buried deep within thousands of comments was a very cute gem. Ryan Good, a longtime friend of Beiber’s, decided to tease Baldwin by suggesting the “Sorry” singer should grow back some controversial facial hair. “Grow the mustache back for the wedding,” Good said in a comment, which was spotted and tweeted by a fan of Baldwin’s on Monday. “Don’t u dare give him that idea you lunatic,” Baldwin said in response.

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jun 29, 2018 at 12:54am PDT His 21-year-old bride-to-be seemingly was not a fan. According to a few fans who ran into Bieber last week, the Canadian crooner was ’stache-free and, according to one tweet, told them: “Yeah, Hailey made me shave it off, well, not made me, but you know, haha.” Another fan backed up that claim: Regardless of why Bieber shaved his mustache, you can’t blame a girl for wanting a smooth smooch on her big day.
