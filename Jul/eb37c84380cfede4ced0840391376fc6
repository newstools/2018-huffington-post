It's well-known that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are tennis fans â€” they've been spotted at many a match over the years. So it was entirely unsurprising when Kensington Palace announced the two would be attending this weekend's Wimbledon final â€” but the twist was that they would be splitting up this year.  Instead, Catherine stepped out Saturday with new sister-in-law, the Duchess of Sussex, also known as Meghan Markle. The royal duo brought some breezy summer style courtside for Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal for the men's semifinal, and to watch Markle's friend, Serena Williams play Angelique Kerber for the ladies' final.   The former Kate Middleton stepped out in a fitted, short-sleeved cream and black-polka dotted dress with gathered detailing at the shoulder and hip, along with nude pumps and cream handbag. Meghan opted for a crisp blue-and-white stripped button down shirt from Ralph Lauren, paired with cream wide-leg trousers, a straw fedora, and black handbag.    Duchess Kate wore her long hair down in her signature style, while Meghan sported the messy bun she's known for.   Prior to the matches, the pair met with former female tennis champions and chatted with ball girls and boys.   During the Kerber-Williams match, Markle could be seen cheering her friend on (Williams and husband Alexis Ohanian attended Meghan and Prince Harry's wedding in May). Serena strikes back.

And it's always nice to have some friendly royal faces in the crowd.
