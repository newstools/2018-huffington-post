  Braai season is a year-round occasion — which means that more than likely, it's time you give your grill a good scrub. Dirty grills are no good for obvious reasons. Leftover bits of food can get stuck to food you're cooking, ruining the taste, while old grease and fat can spread harmful bacteria. But beware of cleaning your grill with a brush — stray metallic bristles have been swallowed by unsuspecting diners, causing all sorts of health problems. Luckily, SFGate has found the easiest — and safest — method to thoroughly clean your grill. All it takes is a towel, some tongs, a few sheets of aluminium foil and a little hard work. And voilà! You've got a clean grill, free of health risks and unwanted food bits. And in the future, after using the grill again, The Daily Meal recommends balling up some more aluminium foil and scrubbing each grill grate individually while it's still warm to prevent further buildup. If you don't have any aluminium foil around, try ultimate grill authority Steven Raichlen's advice. He previously gave HuffPost these tips, relating specifically to gas braais: Read the rest of Raichlen's tips and you'll have the cleanest grill in no time! Happy braaiing!  iI
