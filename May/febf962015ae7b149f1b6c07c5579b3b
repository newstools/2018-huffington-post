Women in the U.K. are having "virginity-restoring" operations. Nine hospitals in England, according to The Daily Mail, have reported a total of 109 "virginity reconstructive procedures" performed between 2007 and 2017.

Maybe they want to share it with their husbands by being as 'pure' as possible again," she said. She noted that for some who are religious, it may be because they are overwhelmed by "sexual guilt". In 48 of the cases, the hospitals were able to provide details of the woman's religion, or lack thereof — 15 were classified as "Christian", eight "Church of England", two Muslim, and 23 "having no religion".

This included 48 women who were single, six married or in civil partnerships, two divorced and three who didn't want to say. Some on Twitter were not convinced:
