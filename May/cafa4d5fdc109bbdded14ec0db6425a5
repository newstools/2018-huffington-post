  Now in its fourth year, the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards continue to bring viewers those goofy moments caught on camera that make it seem as though some animals are just like us. The entries for the 2018 competition are pouring in, from an embarrassed rabbit, "dancing" polar bears, and a fur seal who is apparently having a really bad day with some penguins. We can't wait to see what ends up winning the competition. See some of the latest goofy animal entries below. Share this slide: Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
