It took a doctor telling Australian model Annaliese Gann that she needed to gain weight or risk her organs failing to turn her life around. "I was at the most unhealthy moment in my life. I went to see a doctor, and she told me if I didn't put on weight now, my internal system may start failing," the 22-year-old recently revealed on Instagram. "I was miserable — always cold, lifeless, and struggled to get through the day. I survived on salads and black coffee... I was at the unhealthiest moment in my life." After the doctor's visit, the now proudly curvy model began her journey to recovery. And this started by embracing her bigger frame "for what it is". My #transformationstory continued.... thinner doesn't always mean happier! The girl on the left (me pictured in Sweden size 6) was miserable, always cold, lifeless and struggled to get through the day. I survived on salads and black coffee. This girl didn't understand balance. I was at my unhealthiest moment in my life. I went to see a doctor and she told me if I didn't put on weight now my internal system may start failing. That moment turned my life around forever and I begun my journey to recovery. Pictured right (me now size 14) I'm the healthiest I've ever been. I am not also truly happy! ☺️ I work out because I love my body, not hate it. I embrace my bigger frame for what it is. I now understand BALANCE and I'm happier being my self. A reminder that YOUR natural state is different to everyone else's so try not compare yourself to others. You don't have to look like the people in the magazines to be happy, just be yourself and embrace this beautiful life.

"I am at my natural size. I am truly myself; the healthiest and happiest I've ever been." My #transformationtuesday Size 6 to Size 14. 2013 vs 2018. I was an aspiring runway model spiraling down hill. Not being naturally thin, all I focused on was diet, exercise and how thin I could become (eating disorder). I wasn't happy as I wasn't living life as my true self... 5 YEARS LATER HERE I AM at my natural size. I am truly my self, the HEALTHIEST and HAPPIEST I've ever been😁🙌🏼. I've learnt that we are all unique and amazing in our own way and that we don't need to change for society! We are who we are, and that is beautiful. We've only got one life, so embrace who you truly are and life will embrace you back❤️🙌🏼😌 #beautybeyondsize #bodyconfidence #mystory #plussizemodel #curvyconfidenceco #annaliesegann #recovery A post shared by  ANNALIESE GANN 🐰💕 (@annaliesegann) on May 21, 2018 at 2:36pm PDT   Gann's journey mirrors that of local body activist and curvy model, Marciel Hopkins. "There's no shame in putting on weight, if your body wants to be healthy in a different size than you were forcing it to be," she previously told HuffPost. The Miss SA 2016 finalist lost 14kg in four months to participate in the pageant. Like Gann, she trained two to three hours every day — so hard that her monthly period stopped. She would have baby apples for dinner — but all that's since changed. "Healthy looks different on every body," she recently wrote on Instagram. We all look back at pictures of a different stage in our life and think: "If only I can look like that again." We all keep that specific dress or jeans in our cupboard for when it fits us again. We have babies, move countries and we mature along the way and still we expect our bodies to look like "on my wedding day." Living in the past will never help you to accept your body in the now, so you might as well stop today! Throw out the dress of 10 years ago and stop longing to look the way you did in your pictures of the past. Your body is not meant to look the same throughout your entire life, but unfortunately society communicates to us to that women must always be "in their best shape." So if hating yourself hasn't worked up until now, it's time to try something new. Remember: Healthy looks different on every body! What might look like "healthy" on the picture on the left, was me being obsessed with healthy eating and training 2 to 3 hours a day. I was constantly anxious about what and when I am going to eat. Nothing in that picture reminds me of any form of self love, because I constantly compared myself to an unrealistic beauty goal, forgetting to see my own unique beauty in the process. Don't miss out on one more day of your life, because of the idea you have of your "perfect body." There is no such thing as the perfect body. Accept your body as a vehicle to greatness and not an object to be punished. Bodies should be celebrated every hour of every day! 🎊🥂😍❤️😘 #selflove #bodyacceptance #bodycelebration #bodytransformation #bodypositive #healthnotsize #inshapemyshape #unrealisticbeautygoals #livinginthepast #embracingthenow #beautybeyondsize #everybodyisbeautiful A post shared by  Marciel Hopkins (@marcielhopkins) on May 16, 2018 at 9:33am PDT  Hopkins' most helpful tools to self-love and acceptance? Not comparing yourself or your body to other people's — especially supermodels — and not obsessing over the scale. What has been your most helpful tools to self-love and body acceptance? 1. I've stopped comparing myself to other people, especially the super models I used to look up to. They are still gorgeous, but I know that my body will never be healthy or happy at a size 6. 2. I haven't weighed myself in more than 2 years; I don't even have a scale. Numbers used to define me and I will never allow it to happen again.
