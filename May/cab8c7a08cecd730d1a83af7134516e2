The father of gqom queen Babes Wodumo has taken back his statement on Metro FM's Masechaba Ndlovu following a conversation with his daughter. Speaking to the Sunday Tribune, Welcome Simelane said he changed his stance on the way Masechaba revealed news of the assault Babes allegedly suffered at the hands of her ex-partner, Mampintsha. He said Babes arrived home on Wednesday and they spoke. READ: Babes Wodumo Has Not Yet Laid Assault Charges Against Mampintsha "Babes has arrived home and told us everything. She said she was relieved that Masechaba had asked her about the abuse and that she had responded [of her own free] will," Simelane told the publication.

That he has beaten you in your relationship." At that point, Babes could be seen taking deep breaths and crying while nodding. Simelane, who previously said the interview had left his family with many questions, said he was not ready to talk about his conversation with Babes. Responding to the allegations against him, Mampintsha, who owns West Ink Records to which Babes was previously signed, has admitted only to "overreacting in some incidents" throughout their relationship.
