"I don't stress about my weight anymore; I feel even more beautiful as my belly grows. Thank you so much for behaving yourself. I have never experienced any complications throughout my pregnancy; Jehova ngiyabonga," she said on Instagram. We kinda cannot stop looking at these pictures from the baby shower. I can't express the way I'm feeling right now for what you did. From taking your time and coming to your contributions.
