  J.K. Rowling zinged President Donald Trump on Wednesday with a gibe about his handwriting. The Harry Potter author shared a screenshot of a tweet asking why Trump's signature was "so big" next to one from a graphology website explaining the negative traits associated with people who have large handwriting. Handwriting-graphology.com claims that people who have large handwriting may be "arrogant," "conceited" and "haughty" with "tyrant tendencies" and a "phony personality that may become megalomaniac with lack of a critical sense." "I didn't believe in graphology until about three minutes ago," Rowling replied. Her post was well-received: My son is receiving the Presidential award for his grades in elementary. He came to me yesterday & was sad his brother has Obama on his & he gets What's His Nuts. His really bummed. Last month, Rowling likened Trump to a Boggart â€” the shape-shifting Harry Potter character who takes the form "of whatever most frightens the person who encounters it."
