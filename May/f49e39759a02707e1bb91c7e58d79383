Brrr, winter is officially here! After temperatures dropped significantly throughout most parts of the country to start the week, the SA Weather Service has warned that the cold front — expected to last till Wednesday — will be accompanied by wet conditions. HuffPost spoke to weather forecaster Lulama Pheme, who said, "There is a high possibility of widespread showers and thundershowers over Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal."  "These conditions are likely to spread to the eastern parts of the country (Mpumalanga, KZN), and there is a 60 percent chance of rain expected for Gauteng." Pheme went on to say that Gauteng conditions would improve midweek.   "Johannesburg is expected to have a high of 12°C, while Pretoria is expected to experience a maximum of 15°C, and Vereeniging can expect a high of 11°C." The weekend was even colder in high-lying areas — images of snow atop Sani Pass and the Black Mountain Pass in Lesotho have been shared on social media.
