This past weekend saw dads flooding our Twitter timelines with pictures and videos of them and their children. #DaddiesAndTheirKidsChallenge is one of the cutest things to hit social media and South African fathers showed just how much they love their bambinos. In the pictures, some dads have offered their faces for their daughters to do makeup on and others are seen wearing tuts. Ah, so adorable!
