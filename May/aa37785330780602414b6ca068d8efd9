Of all the trials and tribulations of parenting, perhaps none is as disheartening and just plain disgusting as potty training. Fortunately, many parents have found a place to vent their urine- and poop-filled frustrations: Twitter. We've rounded up 37 funny and too-real tweets from parents about the potty training struggle. Hopefully you don't wet yourself laughing too hard... Me: I can solve all our potty training problems.

Wife: We're not teaching our 2-year-old to go in the yard.

Me: The dog learned in a day.
