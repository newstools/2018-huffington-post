Brooklyn Beckham had his dad David in tears as he gave him the best birthday surprise on Wednesday (2 May). The teenager made an unannounced visit to see his old man as he celebrated his 43rd birthday, with Victoria capturing the joyous moment on camera. In the video, Brooklyn is seen walking into the restaurant where Victoria and David were dining to celebrate his big day.

The couple’s daughter Harper is also heard saying: “I didn’t know Brooklyn was coming.” David later posted the video on Instagram with the caption: “Best birthday surprise , my big boy coming home.” A post shared by bb (@brooklynbeckham) on May 2, 2018 at 11:11pm PDT Brooklyn later shared his own tribute to his dad on his own page adding: “Happy birthday dad xx I love you to the moon and back.” Share this slide:
