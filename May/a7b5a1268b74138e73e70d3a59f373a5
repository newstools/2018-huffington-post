Now we know the story behind the "not-sorry". Miley Cyrus explained on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on Tuesday why she took back an apology for a controversial Vanity Fair photo ― 10 years later. The singer on Monday posted a 2008 New York Post front page about the magazine cover photo, which showed the then-15-year-old "Hannah Montana" star posing nude as she clutched a satin sheet. The newspaper headline screamed "Miley's Shame". She rescinded her regrets a decade later in a most colourful way. Cyrus continued to take a wrecking ball to the past on "Kimmel", saying her little sister, Noah, was at the Annie Leibowitz photoshoot and that there was "nothing sexualised about this on-set. It was everybody else's poisonous thoughts." In retrospect, she said, "I shouldn't be ashamed." As for her apologising at the time, Cyrus said to the host: "I'm sure someone told me to. But you know, that's why I don't do what people tell me to anymore — because that idea sucked." Share this slide:
