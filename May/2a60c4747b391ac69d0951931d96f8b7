The past year has seen an increase in the number of stress-related insurance claims for incidents such as stroke and attempted suicide in Gauteng compared to 2016, statistics recently released by Liberty show. The number of suicide claims in particular was found to be higher than those of road accidents — which the insurance company noted as concerning. "When stress turns into a chronic condition, chances of it easing are slim and we may begin to experience common negative mental and physical reactions such as burnout, depression, panic and even illness. Chronic stress and suicidal thinking are not uncommon," said Cassey Chambers, operations director at the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag). In fact, professionals surveyed last year in Profmed's Stress Index claimed that stress had both an emotional and physical impact on them, with 10.9 percent of the respondents taking time off due to stress-related illness.   Here are more highlights from the claims statistics by Liberty and Momentum: Personal finance expert Maya Fisher-French observed that these statistics reveal that cancer, car accidents and retrenchments are major risks for younger people — more than the country has seen before, therefore highlighting the importance of comprehensive health, accident and disability cover for younger people. She also stressed that South Africans need to take better care of their health, and better care on the roads. "Take the time to do an annual preventative screening for breast or prostate cancer, monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and take a taxi if you've been drinking," she said. Find ways to effectively manage stress, before things become critical, advised Profmed's CEO, Graham Anderson. Take time out for yourself to avoid burnout, exercise, get enough sleep and simplify your life where you can.
