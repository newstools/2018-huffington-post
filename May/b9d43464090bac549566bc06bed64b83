Social media users are weighingin on what they think North West premier Supra Mahumapelo might have meant by "the essence of the absence of presence". Mahumapelo was speaking at what was widely regarded as his final budget speech in the legislature on Tuesday, when towards the end of his speech said: "In some critical instances of our lives, we are called upon as part of humanity to create the essence of the absence of presence."
