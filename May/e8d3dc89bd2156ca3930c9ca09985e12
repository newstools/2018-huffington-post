Fashion designer extraordinaire David Tlale says it's important for established designers to assist those still trying to break into the industry. "I think it is important that as an industry we mentor the new generation because they are the future, we current. We are building a legacy of what brands are all about and where we are going as a South African clothing and textile industry," he said. Tlale also showcased the work created by three of his interns. He was in East London for a workshop for the Buyel'ekhaya fashion development programme, where he hand-picked the three young designers.
