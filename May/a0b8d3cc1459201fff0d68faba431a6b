Rapper Riky Rick has bowed out of the hip-hop world (for now) to spend more time with his family and to focus on getting into the right space mentally. The 30-year-old made the announcement on social media also apologising to people who would feel hurt by his decision.

He said celebrity status made it difficult for him to tell people he's not feeling well. "It's difficult to take time away because people expect you to be superhuman. I am not superhuman. I'm just another human being who wants to find some sort of peace and happiness in life. I'm sorry," he said in one of many tweets.

I am taking time to find my faith before I lose the connection with the people I love the most.  I love you guys. See you later, maybe.  Reacting to announcement fans and music lovers alike took to social media to wish him well. But I feel like this emphasizes the credibility of Riky's brand. "Family Values".

Family takes main priority to him and his supporters should embrace it as part of the package that comes with the brand Riky Rick.  ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘Š family values are very important take your time we will still support you when you are ready to come back not forget to pray and ask for wisdom from God on how to deal with any problems you facing  the most important thing boy is family what you're doing is the best thing u could ever done in yo lyf much respect  I understand dawg. .take care pic.twitter.com/QrlI6r2zv3
