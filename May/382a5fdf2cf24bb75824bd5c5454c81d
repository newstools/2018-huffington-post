When it was announced that Lifetime was making a TV movie about Britain's Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle, we all scoffed and rolled our eyes — but it turns out it rather impressed everyone. Sure, producers may have used some a lot of artistic licence, but after it aired in the U.S. on Sunday (May 14), it actually received a surprising amount of praise on social media. Airing just six days before the couple are set to tie the knot for real, "Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance" took a closer look at how they first fell in love, with Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser (who you may recognise from "Victoria") taking on the roles. Remembering that statement that Prince Harry released 👌🏾✨💫#ARoyalRomancepic.twitter.com/Ox0JGikwIz While Meghan and Harry have kept their relationship largely private, Scarlett Lacey and Terrence Coli — who wrote the TV movie — have insisted they didn't stray too far from Harry and Meghan's real story. "There was so much drama in the real story, we didn't have to make a lot up," Terrance said (via Los Angeles Times). "It almost feels like we cheated in a way." Executive producer Michele Weiss added: "There were plenty of lawyers who looked over everything ... and we cleared." While it isn't yet known what the couple make of the movie (and we seriously doubt we ever will), the British royal family was said to be concerned about it. Director Menhaj Huda told Vanity Fair: "What I've heard is that they're seriously worried about the sex scene. My wife's best friend has been dating the press secretary of the palace."
