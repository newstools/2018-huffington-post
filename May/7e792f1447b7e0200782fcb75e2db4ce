Looking for some fresh vegan inspiration? Thankfully, the times of depressing vegan cakes made from sunflower oil and sandwiches filled with tragic slices of faux meat are over. From actually decent 'cheese' made from coconut (cheers, Sainsbury's) to fake fried chicken that's so decadent it hurts, the UK is getting good at this stuff. From the fish oil sub you've never heard of, to a Parmesan replacement to set your pasta on fire, you need to try these vegan substitutes out.  Important: don't judge it by its name. Nutritional yeast is just regular yeast that's been dried up, to deactivate it. It's used as a Parmesan replacement, as the cheesey, umami flavour and the fact that it comes in sprinkle form makes it perfect to layer on your spaghetti. Hubby @roaming_kuba 😘 and I had watermelon for dinner but now I'm hungry again looking at my lunch photo. 😍 Pasta is just too good! . I sautéed onion, mushrooms, cabbage, peppers and carrots and seasoned them with bay leaf, oregano, thyme, tomato paste and nutritional yeast. ✨ Nooch is so good in sauces and sprinkled on top of everything! . And fortunately one of my avocados worked out today. 🥑😄 Pasta and avocado sounds like a weird combo but it was delicious! 😋 A post shared by  Lisa | vegannomadchick | 🍉 (@vegannomadchick) on Jul 30, 2017 at 11:02am PDT So. Omega 3 doesn't actually come directly from oily fish - it comes via krill that said oily fish eat, who in turn, have eaten algae - which is where the fatty acid comes from. Nowadays, we can cut out the swimming middlemen and get the goodness straight from the algae source, via these handy capsules. did you know that there is more than one type of omega 3 chia, flax, nuts and seeds are high in ALA omega 3, and this is really important for hair and skin health 💇🏼 but DHA omega 3 is the stuff that's important for keeping our hearts and brains healthy and is much harder to get enough of, especially on a plant-based diet 🌱 luckily, our omega 3 softgels contain 100% of your daily guideline amount of DHA omega 3 ~ it's extracted from organically grown algae meaning that is 100% sustainable, 100% cruelty free and 100% vegan 💪🏻 thanks @charlotteemmma for the pic! . . . . . #omega3 #plantbased #vegan #veganshare #vegansofinstagram #poweredbyplants #veganlife #plantpowered #vegansofinsta #veganpower #veganlifestyle #veganuk #veganlondon #veganbrighton #veganbristol #veganscotland #vegancommunity #vegansofig #veganism #veganheath #veganmeal #whatveganseat #veganbreakfast #veganlunch #vegandinner #veganforlife #ethicalbusiness #gogreen #govegan A post shared by  Vegan Omega 3 Softgels (@nothingfishy.omega3) on Jul 19, 2017 at 11:38pm PDT That barbecue flavour – so smokey, so delicious – is one of the best things about meat. With liquid smoke, made from liquified gases released from burning wood, you can get that complexity of flavour. Add to slow cooked jackfruit (another relatively new craze) and wrap with guacamole in a taco, to haricot beans with sweet potatoes or to sliced aubergine to pair with a chopped slaw. Vegan tonight with the smoky beans I made at the weekend from: #choppedtomatoes from a tin #garlic #liquidsmoke #datesyrup #beans & served with #sweetpotato wedges & a quick coleslaw I made from shredded #cabbage #carrot #radish in a dressing of #extravirginoliveoil & #applecidervinegar 👌 A plate of delicious plant based goodness 🤗🥑 #plantbased #eeeeeat #feedfeed #foodie #vegan #recipes #healthyrecipes #veganrecipes #healthy #foodblogger #foodphotographer #foodie #fitness #fitfam #healthynothungry A post shared by  Rachel Ridds (@healthynothungry_rach) on Jul 27, 2017 at 11:51am PDT No, not like the prince of darkness. It's a high protein replacement that's made from wheat. Diced and fried, it's got a wondrously similar texture to legit chicken. Boom. Happy Saturday! We are open as usual till 9pm & just a short walk from the FGV Beerfest for those who like to max their weekend with as much vegan goodness as possible! 😻 A post shared by  Temple of Seitan (@templeofseitan) on Jul 15, 2017 at 3:29am PDT Pancakes, cakes – all the best things – need their ingredients binding together, to make something good. Normally that binder would be an egg. But if you're cutting back, try this clever hack. Grind down one tablespoon of flax seeds in a coffee or spice grinder, before whisking into three tablespoons of water, until it becomes a little jelly-like, for one 'egg'. Use in your recipe as normal.
