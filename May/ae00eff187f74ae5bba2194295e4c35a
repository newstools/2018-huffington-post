On Tuesday the Premier Soccer League (PSL) honoured their outstanding players, coaches and referees for the 2017/18 football season. Mamelodi Sundowns and Maritzburg United were the big winners of the night — Pitso Mosimane of the former scooped Coach of the Season, while Percy Tau took the coveted Footballer of the Season. United's Siphesihle Ndlovu took Young Player of the Season and Midfielder of the Season. The awards ceremony had its fair share of blunders, however, and a comedy of errors culminated in the wrong trophies being handed out to the wrong players.  The four cringe-worthy errors saw Coach of the Year Mosimane being awarded Players' Player of the Season trophy. Percy Tau scooped the Top Goal Scorer award, but was handed the Goal of the Season trophy.  It didn't end there — Siphelele Magubane won Goal of the Season, but was awarded the Coach of the Year trophy. There were thus a few embarrassing moments, from a league that claims to be Africa's best. Nonetheless, it was a glittering end to the 2017/18 football season — especially for Tau, who walked away with almost half a million rands from all his awards.
