“The Big Bang Theory” had a touching season finale tribute to late physicist Stephen Hawking, but sadly it was cut for time. Luckily for fans, the hit CBS sitcom has now released the unaired clip online. But be warned, it’s a real tear-jerker. (Spoilers ahead.) Check out the clip here: In this exclusive, unaired clip from last night’s season finale, the happy couple gets one last gift from #StephenHawking. 💕 #BigBangTheory pic.twitter.com/xgpU7G7Wpw Thursday night’s episode saw “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill officiating the much-hyped wedding ceremony between Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik). The deleted scene takes place after the couple’s nuptials. Emotions run high as the newlyweds unwrap a gift from Hawking, an engraved pocket watch that the scientist ― who guest-starred on the show ― sent them before he died at age 76 in March. Hamill described the scene as a “lovely, touching (& funny) tribute” to the iconic scientist: So sorry they weren't able to include this lovely, touching (& funny) tribute to the great #StephenHawking. Thanks for posting it @bigbangtheory #ShouldaBeenAnHourEpisode https://t.co/JY7LVCmMmh Showrunner Steve Holland told The Hollywood Reporter it was hard for the sitcom “to be super timely” in honoring Hawking, “because we shoot ahead of our airdates.” “The wedding was a big episode and it seemed like a good chance to pay some tribute to him,” Holland said. The unaired scene stirred many emotions on Twitter: pic.twitter.com/5Tfbc2WAs5 In tears again 😢 omg this is so beautiful pic.twitter.com/vbvGwiiyj8 Awwww The world should see this clip!
