Rolls-Royce, known for its elegance and ultimate luxury, took its brand to the next level when it officially launched the Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV (sports utility vehicle) to the world on Friday.   Named after the world-famous diamond found in South Africa, the largest uncut stone ever found, the Cullinan is the first SUV to be launched by the British automobile brand.   The Rolls-Royce Cullinan comes with 22-inch [55cm] wheels and is powered by a 6.75 litre twin-turbo V12 Rolls-Royce engine, which puts out 420kW and 850Nm of torque. It also has an all-new all-wheel drive, all-wheel steer system. Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
