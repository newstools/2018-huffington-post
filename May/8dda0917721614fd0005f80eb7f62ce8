Serena Williams forever. The star returned to Grand Slam tennis on Tuesday after maternity leave, turning heads at the French Open in what she called a "Wakanda-inspired catsuit." Williams said the outfit was designed to help prevent blood clots ― she faced near-deadly complications after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia on Sept. 1 and says she has had several clots in the last year. But the Nike sportswear also had a whimsical side. It made her feel "like a warrior princess kind of, (a) queen from Wakanda," she said, referring to the hit movie "Black Panther." "I always wanted to be a superhero, and it's kind of my way of being a superhero," said Williams, who defeated Kristyna Pliskova, 7-6 (4), 6-4 in the first round. The 23-time Grand Slam title winner added that the ensemble ― which actually was designed before "Black Panther" emerged ― was dedicated to "all the moms out there that had a tough pregnancy and had to come back and try to be fierce." She gave a similar shoutout on Twitter: Share this slide:
