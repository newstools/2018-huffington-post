  Donald Trump was so excited to welcome the first lady home from the hospital that he misspelled his own wife's name in a tweet Saturday. And Twitter couldn't be happier. Trump referred to his wife as "Melanie" instead of Melania, as in "Melanie is doing and feeling really well" after treatment for a kidney condition. It was quickly corrected to Melania, but Twitterdom roared. (The first lady's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Melania was resting comfortably back home and in high spirits.) "Melanie." Just...wow. pic.twitter.com/Apu2HYNP0G "Melanie" quickly trended on Twitter. Most of the responses were on the order of "please tell us about this 'Melanie,'" with others wondering if "she" had contacted Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti. Check out the rest of the digs: Wonderful. But do tell us more about this Melanie. Did you get Melanie out of the house in time? Melanie is probably someone else who signed an NDA. Melanie has already contacted Michael Avenatti. Nothing but respect for our incredible First Lady Melanie. pic.twitter.com/glmXUQdAn6 Melania Melania Melania.

Nopeâ€”it doesn't autocorrect to Melanie. Donald Trump has had so many mistresses he can't even remember his own wife's name anymore. It's not Melanie, you Dotard! MELANIE IS HOME pic.twitter.com/CbP8LZ70Zl I know Donald Trump is trying to upstage the Royal Wedding, but I think it's rude that he got married to "Melanie" just five days after Melania vanished. When your husband calls you "Melanie" and that's not your name: pic.twitter.com/xskWiDTroF I'm just relieved that he accidentally said Melanie and not Ivanka. I say Tomato you say Tomahto
I say Melania you Melanie
I say HIV you say HPV
Let's call the whole presidency off Melanie is home in the White House. Donald, Jr. is heading to the Big House. https://t.co/aGCCb5z1q7 I hope Melanie gets full custody of Barrot.
