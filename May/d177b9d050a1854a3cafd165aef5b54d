The actor who became famous for an Old Spice commercial in which he tells women, "Look at your husband! Now look at me!" only has eyes for one special lady. Isaiah Mustafa, who stars in the Freeform TV show "Shadowhunters", married Lisa Mitchell, a publicist for Warner Brothers, on Saturday, People.com reported. They held their wedding ceremony at Camp Lucy in Austin, Texas. The bride, 36, wore Monique Lhuillier's Emannuela gown and a cathedral-length veil. The groom, 44, was decked out in a custom Elevee tux. His teenage daughter, Haley, walked him down the aisle. The couple met at a comic book convention in March 2016, and they say it was love at first sight, People reported. "I feel like right away when I met him; it was different," Mitchell said. Mustafa and Mitchell had a long engagement. He proposed in December 2016 on a beach in New Zealand, capturing the moment with the help of a drone, per Clevver.com.
