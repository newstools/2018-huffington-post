Former CIA director John Brennan ripped into Donald Trump over the U.S. president's decision on Tuesday to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear treaty. Brennan wrote on Twitter: Brennan, now an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, made similar comments on the air. "This is not just foolish, this is dangerous," he said. "And Mr Trump has repeatedly misrepresented the facts of the nuclear deal with Iran. He's basically lied to the American people and lied to the world about what that deal entails." Brennan was not alone in criticising the move. The leaders of the U.K., France and Germany issued a joint statement expressing "regret and concern". In Iran, one lawmaker said "Trump does not have the mental capacity to deal with issues," and members of parliament burned a paper version of a U.S. flag and a symbolic copy of the Iran deal. Brennan has been a constant critic of the president since leaving office upon Trump's 2017 inauguration. In March, he slammed Trump for hailing the justice department's decision to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe just two days before retirement. "You may scapegoat Andy McCabe," Brennan wrote at the time. "But you will not destroy America... America will triumph over you." Earlier this year, Brennan described himself as "nonpartisan" and told NPR he had respect for both Democratic and Republican presidents he has served. Trump, however, was different. "I think he is dishonest. He lacks integrity. He has very questionable ethics and morality. And he views the world through a prism of how it's going to help Donald Trump," Brennan said. "And I just think that he has not fulfilled the responsibilities of the president of the United States' office." Share this slide:
