Only the most rabidly partisan Mamelodi Sundowns fans were expecting their team to triumph in their match against Spanish giants FC Barcelona on Wednesday night — and those die-hard fans would have been disappointed. As expected, the La Liga champions beat the PSL champions in their international friendly as part of the Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations, but it wasn't the complete drubbing some predicted — Barca won 3-1.

As could be expected, fans on Twitter were full of praise for the only Sundowns player to put one in the Barca net — and quite a few had spicy chirps, too:      '
