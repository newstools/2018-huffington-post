A mom-of-two wants to remind other mothers they can breastfeed anywhere and everywhere, with her latest photography project. Natalie McCain, from the US, feels more breastfeeding images are needed in the public eye because the more they are seen, the less it is "unknown". Her latest collection 'Anytime, Anywhere: Normalising nursing in public' hopes to do that. "The more people are exposed to it, the more normal it becomes," she tells HuffPost UK. "Women don't nurse in public for attention. We don't share these images for praise. We share them so that the next generation of breastfeeding women will have it a little easier." McCain snapped photos of mums breastfeeding outside. "If you're a nursing mama, go out and nurse in the world," she adds. "The more women who nurse in public, the more natural and accepted it becomes. I wanted to create a series that would show how natural and normal breastfeeding in public is. "I want to open the eyes of people who are judgemental towards breastfeeding in public. No mother should feel embarrassed to feed her baby - no matter how she chooses to." McCain asked some of the women to share stories behind the photos, too. Here are a selection of mums featured in her project. View McCain's photography project here. She has previously photographed women's bodies post birth to help mums of all different shapes, sizes and backgrounds to feel "beautiful and empowered". Share this slide:
