Over 250 previously unseen, lost or forgotten photos of the royal family are being released in a book to commemorate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. The book, The Crown From The Crowd, was created after former BBC royal correspondent Jenny Bond asked the nation to look in their photo albums and attics and send in their best amateur pictures of the family at royal events over the years. The pictures collected range from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in an intimate moment, to Princess Diana visiting a school where she tries not to get covered with flour, and Sarah, the Duchess of York, grabbing a camera from a member of the public to take her own picture of them. The pictures date from this year back to snaps from the reign of Queen Victoria in the 1890s. HuffPost UK can reveal a set of exclusive pictures from the book, produced by Photobox, along with details from amateur photographers who took them. The full collection will be presented to Prince Harry and Meghan as "gift from the people" ahead of their wedding day. Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
