"Genius Junior" is a U.S. television show that has viewers stunned! It was first aired on NBC in March and has been a hit with audiences. Children aged 12 and under compete in teams of three. In each round, they are tested on various subjects including spelling, mathematics and memory. The most impressive part, however, has been watching the kids spell words backwards.
