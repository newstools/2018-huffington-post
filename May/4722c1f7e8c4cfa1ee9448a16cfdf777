The ANC's Ronald Lamola addressed a press conference in Johannesburg on Monday morning regarding the governing party's policy decisions on the expropriation of land. This follows the party's conference on land and the way forward, held over the weekend. This is what Lamola said: 1. Government must immediately use section 25, the so-called "property clause" of the Constitution, to implement the policy of expropriation of land without compensation. This must be done, Lamola said, to test assertions in some quarters that the Constitution already enables this form of expropriation.  2. Parliament should table and pass a "redistribution" bill to enable government to ensure the just allocation of land. It should be done in conjunction with the promulgation of the Expropriation Bill, which has been in the works since 2011 and was sent back to Parliament by then-president Jacob Zuma in 2016. Lamola referred to property in urban areas as well as property hoarded for speculation purposes, unused buildings, and state land — as well as "large pieces of land". 3. The ANC's position on changes to section 25 entails considering whether or not section 25.2(b) is clear enough in its intentions. If the constitutional review process finds that it is not, and that it slows down redistribution and reform, it should be changed, the ANC has decided. 4. The ANC's approach to the Constitution is that the party will always defend it as a "transformative document" — and that it provides the government "with a mandate for transformation". (This echoes exactly what President Cyril Ramaphosa said during a recent parliamentary debate.) 5. Lamola added that the ANC does not regard the Constitution as a "sell-out document"; that is is clear on the transformational imperatives and about what legislation should be implemented to enhance this.
