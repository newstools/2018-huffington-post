South Africans are ditching bread and switching back to pap — a staple in many South African households. "Now that we've had a good maize [mielie] harvest, the price of maize has come down, so people are switching back to it, and that affects the consumption of bread," the South African Chamber of Baking's Geoff Penny told Radio 702. This has caused the bread price to drop, with brown bread prices currently lower than in 2014, according to statistics from the Pietermaritzburg Agency for Community Social Action (Pacsa). As it turns out, one can experiment quite a bit in the kitchen with mielie meal — and with a dash of creativity, one can have it for breakfast, lunch or dinner (although preferably, not on the same day!)  BREAKFAST Soft porridge is an easy and delicious win for many parents, but you can also bake breakfast cookies using mielie meal. #umdokwe #morningPap #myMomsPoridge #willAlwaysMissHome #loveMyTummy #HappySoul #HappyTummy A post shared by  Lumka (@totokamgilane) on Mar 10, 2015 at 12:24am PDT       LUNCH It gets better with lunch, as you can make anything from pap and mince pies to pap tert. PAP & MINCE PIES . Comfort food just got upgraded...I combined two of my favourites - pap & mince - and turned it into individual pies! Best of all, my recipe uses leftover pap and gets a speedy prep shortcut from using @knorrflavour savoury mince dry cook-in-sauce! #leavenofoodbehind and make the most of your leftovers! #ad #zolanene #recipe #linkinbio . . #knorr #instafood #yum #instagood #food #whatsfordinner . . 📷 @matannakatz Surface: @caesarstonesa A post shared by  Zola Nene (@zola_nene) on Mar 29, 2018 at 9:16am PDT      DINNER From fuss-free uphuthu and maas to pap squares topped with spinach or served with chakalaka, you are spoilt for choice with dinner.
