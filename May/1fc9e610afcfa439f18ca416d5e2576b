King James has done it yet again. LeBron James led the Cleveland Cavaliers past the Boston Celtics 87-79 in a thrilling Game 7 showdown on Sunday night. James led his team in just about every category with 35 points, 9 assists and 15 rebounds over 48 minutes. "He's unbelievable," Celtics coach Brad Stevens told the Washington Post. "Does it at this level, with the pressure, with the scrutiny. Doesn't matter. Our goal going into the series was to make him exert as much energy as humanly possible... but he still scored 35. It's a joke." The victory puts the Cavaliers into the NBA finals for the fourth straight year. It also marks the eighth consecutive year that James will be in the finals, having reached it the previous four years with the Miami Heat. They'll face the winner of Monday night's Game 7 showdown between the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets. On social media, at least five top hashtags trended around the game, and most of them ended up hailing the king: Share this slide:
