"Two words: Frustratingly wonderful." That's how dad and cartoonist Brian Gordon describes fatherhood. Indeed, fatherhood is full of chaos, confusion and a whole lotta love. From pool tosses and Lego projects to bathroom disasters and mealtime fails, there are endless opportunities for humor and heart. "It's a LOT harder than you think, and you will have no idea what you're doing, despite those classes you took and the books you read," Gordon told HuffPost when asked what he would say to his pre-kid self. "We're all just making it up as we go along, every last one of us." In honor of Father's Day, here are 41 comics about the highs and lows of fatherhood from Gordon and other creative dads.
