This week HuffPost covered a story about recent farm attacks in the Free State. We spoke to the farm owners and the workers on how these crimes have affected their lives. South Africa lost one of its best apartheid photographers, David Goldblatt, and we spoke to the owner of the Goodman Gallery to give insight into the important work he has done. As winter is here and keeping warm is top of the agenda, Chef Musa from restaurant Love Revo gave us some brilliant soup recipes to keep us warm. Enjoy the videos of the week! 1.
