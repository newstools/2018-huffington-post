On Wednesday, a man accused of killing little Stacey Adams appeared in court in Mitchell's Plain on murder and rape charges. It is a case that has devastated that community and sent shockwaves through the country. But it is part of a broader phenomenon of child murders in South Africa, and one of at least five child murders currently in court. Nationally, between 800 and 900 children are killed in South Africa alone according to police figures, The Star reported. NGOs put the number of child murders in the Western Cape at 66 for 2017, according to TimesLive. The 25-year-old man, believed to be Stacey's mother's boyfriend, appeared in court on Wednesday for a bail application. He was reportedly arrested and charged with Stacey's rape and murder. Eyewitness News (EWN) reported that the suspect confessed to killing the child. He was arrested on Sunday. According to News24, Stacey was found dead in Eastridge, Mitchells Plain, on Sunday in a shallow grave dug next to a Wendy house, on the property where her mother lived with her boyfriend. Stacey reportedly stayed with her grandmother across the road but frequently moved between the two houses. The Daily Voice reported that Mitchell's Plain community members stormed the house where the suspect lived, as police questioned him inside. The home was reportedly petrol bombed. The suspect's aunt, who owns the property, reportedly said the family was devastated by what had happened and said they "never expected him [the suspect] to do something like this" as he also has a six-year-old child. It emerged on Wednesday that the suspect is charged with six other cases, including a murder charge that is still pending. These cases were withdrawn, however, owing to a lack of evidence. Here are more child murders that are making their way through the courts: A body has been found under the Strand bridge. Police are yet to confirm if it is of a 5-year-old #Minentle. pic.twitter.com/ElEHgGRmet â€” Veve (@LudidiVelani) June 4, 2017
