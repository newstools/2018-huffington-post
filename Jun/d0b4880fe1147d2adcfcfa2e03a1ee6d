No eternal sunshine here. Jim Carrey's latest political artwork paints a sinister vision of the White House. Glowing eyes peer from the windows, while a "prisoner" ― presumably Donald Trump ― does the bidding of evil forces. "You will be our hands in the world. It's time for us to Tweet again," the demons' voices say in Carrey's caption. Carrey has turned his comedic acting skills to paintings — often aimed at Trump and his administration. Many of his artworks feature caricatures of the president, but the "Liar Liar" star let his latest make a statement without a visual Trump presence. "The Late Show" host Stephen Colbert was also on a satanic wavelength, with a "Devil's Advocate" bit on his programme on Monday. The way Colbert and Carrey see it, there will be hell to pay for the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their migrant families at the border. Share this slide:
