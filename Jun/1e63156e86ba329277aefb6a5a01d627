Tom Daley and his husband Dustin Lance Black have announced the birth of their first child, revealing that their son arrived earlier this week. The couple went for a traditional announcement, sharing news of Robert Ray's arrival in U.K. broadsheet The Times. A notice posted in Saturday's paper read: "BLACK-DALEY On 27th June 2018 to Thomas Robert Daley and Dustin Lance Black, a son, Robert Ray." The baby is named after Tom's dad, who died in 2011 after suffering a brain tumour. The couple announced that they were expecting a baby with the help of a surrogate back in February, and spoke about their decision to do so on a number of occasions. "We love our surrogate," Dustin said in March. "No human being is for rent; this is about relationships. She'll be a part of our life for a very long time." The couple celebrated the upcoming arrival with a baby shower in April.
