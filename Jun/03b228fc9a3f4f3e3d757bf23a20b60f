Halala Sjava, indlalifa lase Ningizimu Africa! South African hip-hop artist Sjava made history on Sunday when he scooped a BET Award for the International Viewers' Choice for Best New Act to Sjava at the BET Awards pre-show.  Sjava scooped the award for his contribution to the 2018 Black Panther album with the song titled 'Seasons'. The song's selling point is the hook where he talks about poverty, jealousy and negativity while growing up in South Africa.   The isiZulu-speaking artist, who has always stayed true to his roots in SA hip-hop, also became the first South African hip-hop artist to win a BET Award. As expected, South Africans took to Twitter to shower him with praise.
