This weekend saw Nigerian superstar musician Wizkid doing his thing on the Dolce & Gabbana catwalk. Starboy rocked a chic black suit with gold embellishments paired with snazzy formal shoes for the top designer at the Milan Men's Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2019. He also shared a stage with supermodel Naomi Campbell, and pictures of the pair together have been all over social media.     @dolcegabbana @stefanogabbana ❤️🦅 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 17, 2018 at 7:23am PDT  💧 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 17, 2018 at 7:17am PDT  💧❄️ A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 17, 2018 at 7:15am PDT  STARBOY 4 @dolcegabbana ! @stefanogabbana ❤️🦅🌹🇳🇬🇮🇹 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 16, 2018 at 7:06am PDT  Starboy 4 @dolcegabbana ❤️🌹🦅🇳🇬 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 16, 2018 at 6:57am PDT  @dolcegabbana ❤️❤️🦅🌹 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 16, 2018 at 6:56am PDT  @iamnaomicampbell @dolcegabbana ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🦅🦅🦅 A post shared by  Wizkid (@wizkidayo) on Jun 16, 2018 at 6:52am PDT
