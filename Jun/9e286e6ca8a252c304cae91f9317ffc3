When rapper Riky Rick took to the stage at the SA's Most Wanted Youth Celebration concert this weekend, he delivered no less than the electrifying performance he's known for — except that this was his last for a while. In May, the star announced that he was going into retirement to spend time with his family and find himself again. Although at the time he'd said his performance at the Back To The City concert would be his last, Riky pulled up at Saturday's concert; a Youth Day celebration hosted by Cassper Nyovest.

According to Cassper, the venue was sold out. Riky took to social media to thank his fans for their support throughout his career. He accompanied the post with beautiful video of highlights from his performance. Watch it below:  ‪It's official!!!! We sold out The Sun Arena Times Sqaure. Dreams come true!!!! Can't wait to get on stage!!! Thank you!!! We did it boys!! #SAsMostWantedYouthCelebration ‬  Riky may be officially "gone", but he'll be back on stage come September — perhaps someone should explain the difference between "retirement" and "a sabbatical" to him?  Fans lauded him for his talent as a performer and wished him well during his time off.
