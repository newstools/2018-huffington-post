Live-tweeting can be hazardous. Actor Neil Patrick Harris appeared to mock backstage host Rachel Bloom during the Tony Awards on Sunday â€• and he probably regretted it. Bloom, from TV's "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," had a similar role on the Tonys broadcast last year, but nothing apparently rang a bell with Harris, a four-time Tonys host. Who is the woman in the top hat backstage at @TheTonyAwards? Gideon remarked that she says 'like' and 'oh my god' a lot. I'm confused... Bloom jogged his memory. I'm a big fan of yours. We've met numerous times and my husband, Dan Gregor, wrote for "How I Met Your Mother" for 5 years. Notably, he wrote the episode where your character finally meets his father. Harris, who starred for nine seasons as Barney on "HIMYM," made an awkward recovery. Indeed! Well said. Thanks for the reminder. How was backstage? Share this slide:
