Store in the fridge until needed. Using a toothpick or skewer, alternate the cauliflower and shrimp. Dip each skewer in the batter then fry in hot oil at 160C until golden brown. Serve warm. How to make the ketchup: Dissolve cornstarch in water with the white sugar, turmeric powder and garlic.Add lemon juice and cumin powder and bring to a boil until it begins to thicken. Remove from heat and add the coriander and olive oil, stirring well to incorporate into a glossy thick texture. Allow to cool. If it sets, simply purée in a blender to keep it smooth.  Martin Morales is the chef and brains behind London-based restaurant Ceviche. He’s shared his chicharron pork sandwich recipe (serves 4), a quintessential Peruvian sandwich commonly served on roadside cafes in the Andes of Peru and also in Lima. It’s a little more high maintenance, but well worth the effort. “Add a fried egg and it’s the bomb,” says Morales. Ingredients for the sandwich: :: 1kg pork shoulder (or pork belly):: 2 tbsp salt:: 1 onion, halved:: 2 bay leaves:: Vegetable oil, for frying (optional):: 4 crusty bread rolls :: 1 portion of julienned Salsa Criolla (recipe to make it below):: 1 portion of chilli mayo For the sweet potato fries: :: 2 sweet potatoes, peeled:: Corn flour, for dusting:: Vegetable oil, for deep-frying How to make Salsa Criolla: Finely slice 1 red onion, 2 cored and deseeded medium tomatoes and 2 deseeded and deveined red chillies as finely as you can. Soak the red onion in iced water for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly and then mix with 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 finely chopped coriander sprigs. Season with salt and black pepper. How to make the sandwich: Cut the pork into fairly large chunks and rub all over with the salt. Leave tomarinate for at least a few hours, but preferably overnight. When you are ready to cook the pork, rinse it well to remove the salt and pat dry with kitchen paper. Place the pork in a wide-based saucepan. Scantily cover the pork with water, add the onion and bay leaves and bring to the boil over medium heat. Skim off any foam that appears on the surface and then partially cover. Leave to simmer over low heat until the water has completely evaporated. Test the pork for tenderness by piercing the meat with a fork or skewer. If it is not yet falling apart, add some more water and continue to simmer. Take the lid off and let the pork fry in its own fat over high heat, turning regularly and adding a little oil if needed, until it is crispy and golden brown and the meat is very tender. This should take about 20–30 minutes. Cut the sweet potatoes into thin strips, a similar size to French fries. If you have a deep-fat fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 170°C. If not, pour the oil to a depth ofabout 5cm in a large, deep saucepan, making sure that it is no more than half full. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop in a cube of bread; if it sizzles and turnsgolden, the oil is ready. Dust the sweet potatoes with corn flour and deep-fry them until they are golden and crisp. Fill the crusty rolls with the pork, sweet potato fries, plenty of Salsa Criolla andsome chilli mayo if using.  This recipe comes from Elton Júnior, executive chef of Dalva e Dito, a restaurant owned by esteemed Brazilian chef Alex Atala. Júnior describes it as an “easy” dish to make, however you’ll have to head to your local butcher’s for some pig’s trotters if you want to make it truly special. Ingredients for the vegetable broth: :: 1 white onion:: 1 carrot:: 1 celery stem:: 1 leek:: 500ml water:: 1 bay leaf:: 1 thyme branch For the caldinho: :: 80g black beans:: Vegetable broth:: 25g bacon chopped into small cubes:: 15g pig’s trotters:: 1 garlic clove:: 12g white onions:: 1 pinch of salt:: 1 sprinkle of chives:: 5ml olive oil How to make it: Gather all the ingredients for the vegetable broth inside a pan and cook it for two hours on a low heat. Strain it and save the liquid broth. Put the beans, the vegetable broth, the bacon and the pig’s trotter inside a pan. Cook it until the beans start to dissolve. Retrieve the foot, process it and pass it through a sieve. Braise the garlic and the onion in a frying pan with the spur olive oil. Gather all preparations and serve.
