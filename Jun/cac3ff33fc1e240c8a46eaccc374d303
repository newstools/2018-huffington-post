Talk about one hell of a game, El Diego! Diego Maradona, who wears his heart on his sleeve whenever his beloved Argentina compete in the Fifa World Cup, had one hell of a 90-minutes, as his country sealed a dramatic 2-1 win over Nigeria on Tuesday. Diego Maradona really needs help...it's sad. pic.twitter.com/VDur6iD336  He was the most, er... animated character whenever the cameras turned on him. His, ahem, high spirits were always apparent, from dancing with Nigerian fans before the game started, to posing as a Christ-like figure, to passing out, then swearing at a couple of fans after Argentina scored the winner later on, to eventually being hospitalised after the emotional rollercoaster of a game. In a heartbeat, Maradona became the Twitter meme king — all his best moments were captured and went viral as he showed what some euphemistically called his "overzealous passion" for the game and his country. Maradona highlights vs Nigeria looool this guy is something else man ������ pic.twitter.com/v2Dnuryuhs  Here is a look at how his 90 minutes looked like.

We hope he is fine. #947BreakfastClub #WorldCup pic.twitter.com/1l7yvNlEJt Before the game, Maradona got the party started by dancing with a random Nigerian fan, setting the tone of how his night was going to turn out. Christ-like pose   When the game started Maradona — who once scored the infamous "Hand of God" goal — posed as the son of God, imploring the heavens' favour as his team took the field. Let the celebrations begin   Once Argentina scored the opening goal, courtesy of Lionel Messi, Pandora's box opened and El Diego went buck wild. He could not contain his excitement nor stop celebrating — which eventually led to him passing out for the remainder of the first half. It's exhausting being Maradona. pic.twitter.com/5n3xp8lUx5  Robbie Williams impression   Eventually, Argentina were staring World Cup elimination in the face, tied at 1-1. Then Marco Rojo turned into a national hero, scoring the goal that sealed the victory they needed to get to the next round. As expected, El Diego went wild, this time showing zap signs to a section of fans sitting below him in the stands — a gesture World Cup watchers were already familiar with, thanks to Robbie Williams' tournament-opening performance last week.

Early on Wednesday morning, the irrepressible party animal posted an update on his Facebook page indicating that he was fine after the health scare, and will be ready on Saturday to go again, when Argentina face France in the knockout stages.
