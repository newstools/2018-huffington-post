One of The Backstreet Boys' most famous songs, "I Want It That Way," has some confusing lyrics that have been hotly debated for some time. And now, model and internet den mother Chrissy Teigen has gotten to the bottom of it for all of us. At the end of the song, the group sings: I never wanna hear you say I want it that way 'Cause I want it that way Right now you're thinking, "What on Earth does that mean?" And that's OK, because you're not alone. Teigen asked the same thing Friday. For the rest of us at the bottom of the Twitter totem pole, those questions would have simply floated out into the ether. But when Teigen asks questions, people come with answers. And that's exactly what The Backstreet Boys did. Still following? What the boys are saying is, they don't want to hear you wishing for bad things to happen in the relationship — for heartaches, mistakes or distance — and that's the way they want it. Teigen continued the discussion with her followers: But it seems like this mystery has been solved. And the world is safe again. Thank you, Chrissy Teigen.
