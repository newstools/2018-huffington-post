A Congressional intern who yelled a profane greeting at Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol last week has been identified as an intern for Senator Maggie Hassan (Democrat â€“ New Hampshire), the lawmaker's spokesperson told The Hill on Monday. "We are aware of the situation and have taken disciplinary action, including a one-week suspension and revoking her Congressional intern ID badge (thereby restricting her access to the Capitol), in response to her breach of office policies regarding respectful and appropriate conduct," Aaron Jacobs, Hassan's director of communications, told the outlet. "We also facilitated contact with Capitol police." A widely circulated video showed Trump walking near the Capitol Rotunda to meet with Republican Party lawmakers about proposed immigration legislation last week. Right before the president walks into the frame, however, a woman can be heard screaming: "Mr President, fuck you!" The woman was identified in several media accounts as 21-year-old Caitlin Marriott. Fox News reports that she'll continue to work in Hassan's office through August. Several members of the Trump administration have been faced with angry members of the public in recent days. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by activists chanting "shame" in a Mexican restaurant last week, and Trump adviser Stephen Miller's apartment building has become a regular target of protestors. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was also politely asked to leave a farm-to-table restaurant in Virginia over the weekend, prompting a bevvy of outrage and support on both sides of the aisle.
