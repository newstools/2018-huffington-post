Face it: You wouldn't be half as cool as you are now if it weren't for your dad being pretty damn cool to begin with. To honor the guys our fathers were before having kids cramped their style, we asked readers to share their favorite throwback pics. With dads this cool, it's an honor and a privilege to be a chip off the ol' block. Note: Some readers requested that we use only their first names to protect their privacy. Submissions have been edited for style and clarity.
