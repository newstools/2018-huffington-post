  With Pride Month starting internationally, it's important to remember that Pride celebrations look and feel different in various countries and cultures around the world. From Albania to India, Pride truly is a worldwide celebration of LGBTQ+ identity and freedom on a global scale, and these photos truly embody that sentiment. Happy Pride! #TheFutureIsQueer is HuffPost's month-long celebration of queerness, not just as an identity but as an action in the world. Find all of our Pride Month coverage here.
