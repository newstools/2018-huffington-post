While the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) has made a significant amount of money at the box office, it clearly has a lot of catching up to do when compared with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

It's also taken a beating from critics, with only "Wonder Woman" receiving universally positive reviews. Evan Puschak, the host of the weekly pop culture YouTube series "The Nerdwriter," breaks down why the DCEU can't seem to captivate the public like the MCU does. And, as he argues, it has a lot to do with the action scenes.
