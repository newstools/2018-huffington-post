The two, who became best friends after meeting during the singing competition last year, will open their home for the judges, J'Something and David Higgs, as well as their fellow competitors, to roll out their instant restaurant in the bid to win a spot in the next round of the competition. Don't forget to tune in to #MKRSA tomorrow on @mnettv Channel 101 at 18:00 to meet Table 1! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #DinuAfrika #durban #southafrica #Entertainment #durbanentertainment #food #foodie #instafood #cooking #MinnieNtuli #CapeTown #johannesburg  They have often said they love eating as much as they love cooking.
