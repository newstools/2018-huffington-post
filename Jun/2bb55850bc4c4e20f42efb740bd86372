While there might be no small roles in theater, as the saying goes, there were some big winners at the 72nd Tony Awards. Stars of stage and screen descended on Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Sunday for Broadway's biggest night. Hosted by Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban, the awards show celebrated a tremendous year in theater ― the best-attended in Broadway history ― and honored actress Chita Rivera and composer and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber with Special Tony Awards for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre. Blockbuster musicals "Mean Girls" and "SpongeBob SquarePants," led the nominations, with 12 nods each, and revivals "Angels in America" and "Carousel" each had 11 nominations. The buzzy "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" wasn't far behind and nabbed 10 nominations. But it was "The Band's Visit," an adaptation of the film of the same name about an Egyptian band that gets lost while traveling through Israel, that was the big winner of the night. The musical walked away with 10 awards, nearly sweeping the musical acting categories, as well as scoring trophies for Best Musical, Best Direction, Best Score, and Best Book, among many others.
