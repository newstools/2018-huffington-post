David and Victoria Beckham appeared to hit back at divorce rumours on Sunday, showing a united front at a London Fashion Week event. The couple attended the Kent and Curwen show on Sunday afternoon - where they sat on the FROW, naturally - and in a rare move, Victoria posted loved-up snaps of their day on Instagram: A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Jun 10, 2018 at 7:13am PDT A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Jun 10, 2018 at 8:02am PDT "#momentcaptured ‚ù§," she wrote underneath one photo, which showed David standing with his hands on her shoulders.
