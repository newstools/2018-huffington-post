Like I can dance and I know how to treat a lady and I make nice music. Kahle kahle I should be the president of iy Dudla  Out of the blue, Lvovo reached out to plus-size model and photographer, Thick Leeyonce on the timeline. Heeyyyyyyyyyyyyy @ThickLeeyonce 😘  Goodnight my size @ThickLeeyonce ungiphuphe❤️❤️❤️  Her response did not inspire any hope for Lvovo's aspirations. 👀 https://t.co/fkeHX8wqE1  Shortly after, she tweeted how much she loves her boyfriend who makes her laugh.
