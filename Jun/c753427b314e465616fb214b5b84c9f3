There may have been better days in the past for the South African Music Awards (Samas), but all is not lost — despite the glitches and embarrassing moments from recent events. The Samas are the SA music industry's highest honour, and have been dubbed the "South African Grammys". HuffPost spoke to Phil Mpela, an entertainment commentator who believes the awards can still reclaim their glamorous status. "The Samas are not as exciting as they used to be. We're in an age of social media right now; an age of different platforms where musicians can showcase their own talents ... it is to be expected that they would not be as exciting," he said.

Such oversights don't make sense at all, because it's little things like that hurt them. They have been around for so long, they should have learnt by now," he said.
