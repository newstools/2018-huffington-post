We thought Season 8 of "Game of Thrones" was still about a year away, but it looks like winter has come early in the form of a DreamWorks movie. In the new trailer for "How To Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden Kingdom," we see Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and the other Vikings face a new threat and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? All we know is that it looks like an animated Westeros. Did "How To Train Your Dragon" take some inspiration from"GoT"? There's a white dragon, lots of burning ships and what looks like a King in the North. Oh, and you know Kit Harington voiced a character in this movie, too? We repeat: The King in the North is in this movie! Memes mashing up "How To Train Your Dragon" and "Game of Thrones" existed before now, but this new trailer is too similar to ignore. Two veteran reporters have teamed up to bring you the evidence. Judge for yourself:      Share this slide:
