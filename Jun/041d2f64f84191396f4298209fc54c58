Remember the 2010 Fifa World Cup slogan, when the world's biggest tournament was in South Africa? "Feel it, it is here"? Well, it seems former sports minister Fikile Mbalula and Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimance are definitely feeling the hype of the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia — together, that is.  The pair seems to have a bit of a bromance going, as Mbalula has been posting photos of the two attending World Cup games together.
