Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have thought themselves quite the pair of rebels when they decided to break from the traditional fruitcake at their wedding, but that's nothing compared with this daring new trend: dangling cakes. Yep, hanging wedding cakes are the latest way to make your celebration more Instagrammable and showstopping than the one before (sorry, Ashley). While we can't give the precarious trend points for practicality, we gotta say, it is eye-catching. (Just maybe keep the ring bearer and flower girl away.) Here are some other dangling cakes that make us as nervous as they make us hungry. Driftwood + sailing rope reads surprisingly more beachy than "SOS." Voluminous greens create an optical illusion that will leave your guests floored. Straight out of your favourite trendy borough. Sometimes less is more. Just like the one you grew up with in your backyard. Because you're fancy. More from PureWow:
