If she could turn back time, Cher would still count Tom Cruise among her top five favourite lovers. In a game of "Spill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts" on "The Late Late Show" with James Corden on Tuesday, the 72-year-old singing legend was given a near-mission impossible: Eat dried caterpillar, or list the four lovers who occupied her top five list with Cruise. She declared in 2013 that Cruise was on the list. Cher chewed up the caterpillar, but then told Corden she didn't remember making the Cruise remark. "But do you remember doing it?" he asked coyly. "Yup!" said Cher, who dated the movie star in the 1980s. Find out in the clip below how Cruise made his way on to Cher's top five list. Share this slide:
