  The new season of SABC3's Real Talk kicked off to much fanfare. Media personality Bonang Matheba was in the hot seat opening up to new host Azania Mosaka about her life, her career as well as, well, a lot of other things. Soon after the show started, it made the trends columns with people's reactions coming through thick and fast. The interview was about her childhood ambitions to become a teacher, her mentors Basetsana Khumalo and Khanyi Dlomo came through with praises for her. The beneficiaries to her bursary fund were also brought into the show. ....today was a special day.... 🙏🏽👑😌 Thank you for tuning in... #RealTalk But it was the questions pertaining to her personal life that many were looking forward to. On the backdrop of her relationship with rapper AKA, Azania asked Bonang if she ever thinks about DJ Zinhle, who was dating the rapper at time of their alleged affair, Bonang said yes but also adding she things about a lot of other things. "I think about a lot of people all the time. I think about a lot of things people say all the time and I think about what choices people make all the time," she said. Asked what she thinks about her own choices relating to that relationship, Bonang insisted she thinks a lot of things. When pressured to give a clearer response, the reality TV star said although she's taken responsibility and has moved on, she would not speak about her personal life publicly.   Many lauded her for opening up and handling the interview like a pro while others felt it lacked personality and may have been too rehearsed. But in true Mzansi fashion, people have now adopted the phrase and coined it to suit their day to day life situation. And it's hilarious.
