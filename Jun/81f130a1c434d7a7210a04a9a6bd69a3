Lawyers acting on behalf of sports presenter Ashwin Willemse reportedly plan to approach the Equality Court to resolve matters which led to the former Springbok player storming off stage live on TV. Jacaranda FM reported on Wednesday that Willemse's lawyer, Nqobizitha Mlilo, said they are at an "advanced stage" of preparing court documents.   Sport24 reported that Willemse declined to take part in the SuperSport investigation into his TV walkout because he felt it was not the right forum to express his viewpoint. In a letter written by Willemse's attorneys to Advocate Vincent Maleka SC - who was tasked with investigating the matter - Willemse reportedly remained adamant that racism had caused his outburst. Willemse left the set when he claimed he "felt patronised" by fellow presenters, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha.   In his report, Maleka found no suggestions of racism on the part of presenters Mallett and Botha but expressed regret that Willemse refrained from taking part. Mlilo reportedly maintains the "whole incident is rooted in racism".
