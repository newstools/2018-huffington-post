Ntando Duma and Junior De Rocka's baby girl, Sbahle Mzizi, is celebrating her first birthday (on June 28), and she could not be any cuter. Both parents took to Instagram to wish her well — and to express how proud they are to have... well, made her.

She is currently at >129,000 followers. According to her bio, Sbahle, which loosely translated from isiZulu means "we are beautiful", is "daddy's fav girl, mommy's little princess and a future president". In a lengthy Instagram post, Ntando said Sbahle is the reason she works hard. "Watching you grow up has been such a blessing! So much joy, [a] lot of impact and plenty of stress. Above it all though, raising an intelligent little human who's as bubbly and beautiful has been the most meaningful part of my life.
