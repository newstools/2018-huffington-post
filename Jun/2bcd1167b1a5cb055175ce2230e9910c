Henri van Breda, the convicted murderer responsible for murdering his parents and brother with an axe, was on Thursday sentenced to three life terms in prison by Judge Siraj Desai in the Western Cape High Court. Last month, Van Breda was found guilty of murdering his parents and brother with an axe, and of the attempted murder of his sister. According to News24, count 1 was for the murder of Rudi van Breda (life sentence); count 2 was for the murder of Martin van Breda (life sentence); count 3 was for the murder of Teresa van Breda (life sentence); count 4 was for the attempted murder of Marli van Breda (15-year sentence); and count 5 was for obstructing the course of justice (12 months' imprisonment).   South Africans took to social media and expressed how they felt about the sentencing with some hailing the South African justice system:   #VanBreda Case Predenct must prevail here! Age or not, personal circumstances or not!
This Judge Desai should have been the one who presided in the Oscar case!
3 Life Imprisonment, 15 years+ 12 months!
Now this is what Justice is and should be!             I'm glad that justice truly prevailed. I hope this sends a strong message to would-be perpetrators who think that they can get away with the crime because of their "social standing". Justice doesn't care about that! #VanBreda
