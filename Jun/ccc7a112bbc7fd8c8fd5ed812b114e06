There was something fun and simple about the 1990s. The internet was barely a thing, the closest we had to the Marvel Cinematic Universe was the (amazing) X-Men animated series, and MTV still played music. The people of Twitter decided they'd had enough with the present day and instead chose to get nostalgic about the end of the 20th century. These are some of the best tweets from today's trending hashtag #MyFavoriteThingAboutThe90s. This is a tough one #TwitterUniverse. @Rugrats and @Destinyschild are definitely up there. But this bad boy wins for sure. Now thinking about all the time I spent raising this thing and have nothing to show for it! ðŸ˜  #MyFavoriteThingAboutThe90spic.twitter.com/GMxL6vOWbk
