DJ Black Coffee has taken the world by storm with his African-inspired take on electro music, and now he is working on a new project: to open an arts school in South Africa. Speaking to Billboard last week, the South African DJ said the school would be designed by Louis Vuitton menswear director and frequent collaborator Virgil Abloh. "White Coffee" wt @virgilabloh Next stop Monte-Carlo @JimmyzMC tonight.

"We've been working on building a music, art and fashion school in a deserted part of Johannesburg," he said. South African artist Nelson Makamo and clothing designer Laduma Ngxokolo will also be part of this project, which he says will help to transform deserted areas in the city centre.

"The opportunities and spaces will offer cultural experiences, boutique stores, restaurants and a learning centre."
