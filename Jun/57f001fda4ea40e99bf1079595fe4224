The women of Old Hollywood somehow managed to look glamorous wherever they were, including the beach. And it's not their hair and makeup we're talking about ― though both were always impeccably done ― it's their swimsuits. For the women of cinema's golden age, one-piece swimsuits were extremely popular. These usually featured flattering sweetheart necklines, ruching throughout the body and low-cut leg openings, and sometimes came in fun prints. Around the 1940s, stars like Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner wore two-pieces, with high-waisted, full-coverage bottoms and structured halter tops. (The bikini as we know it ― low-rise bottoms with higher-cut leg openings and a more bra-like top ― was introduced to the U.S. in 1946, Slate notes.) There's something about vintage swimsuits that just screams "bombshell." Sure, they provided more coverage than the itsy-bitsy, teenie-weenie bikinis favored by Instagram "it" girls and models these days, but they're no less sexy. Unsurprisingly, considering everything old becomes new again, vintage swimsuits have clearly inspired a number of current retailers and brands, most notably ModCloth and Lisa Marie Fernandez. Look to these Old Hollywood stars for all the swimwear inspiration you need. And always remember: The only thing you need to have a "bikini body" is a bikini, or any swimsuit, and a body.
