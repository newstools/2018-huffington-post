"America's Got Talent" contestant Amanda Mena got to hit back against her bullies on U.S. television. The 15-year-old singing sensation earned a Golden Buzzer on Tuesday's episode from judge Mel B, vaulting her into the competition's live shows. Amanda told the judges that when she moved to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic (the country that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti) at the age of four, she "didn't know a word of English". "I got bullied a lot," she said. "So all that kinda gave me tough skin." Amanda then wowed with her cover of "A Natural Woman". An enthralled Mel B told her: "This is what I'm going to say to all those bullies," then pushed the Golden Buzzer. Amanda won "La Voz (The Voice) Kids" on the Spanish-language network Telemundo when she was 11 â€• and her polish showed on "AGT". Watch below. Share this slide:
