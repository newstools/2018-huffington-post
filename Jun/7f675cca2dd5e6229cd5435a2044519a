  A tweet describing a heroic act by an off-duty doctor in London has sparked a heartwarming conversation about the similar acts performed by off-shift medical staff across the world. On June 10, trainee lawyer Lottie Ritchie took to Twitter to explain that she was at London Bridge when there was a P.A. announcement for a doctor to assist. "A woman near me looked at the guy she was with and just handed him her coffee and then RAN like a superhero," Ritchie recalled. "It was amazing." Her tweet really resonated with others, who were prompted to share stories of how off-duty medical staff had gone above and beyond to help them (or others).
