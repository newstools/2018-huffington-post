  In case you haven't noticed, ugly sneakers are cool. In fact, they have been for a while. Outlets including GQ, The Cut, Dazed and Elle have all written about them, and one quick Google search for "ugly sneakers" (literally) will bring up plenty of on-trend options. As Vogue Italia described them, ugly sneakers (sometimes referred to as "dad sneakers") are usually chunky and feature double or triple soles. And for the record, ugly isn't a bad thing when it comes to this style, and the trend is still going strong. Instagram influencers and celebrities alike apparently can't get enough of their ugly sneakers. Just a few minutes spent scrolling through social media feeds reveals photo after photo of people like Bella Hadid and Eva Chen rocking clunky shoes that look like your dad's lawn-mowing sneakers. And don't be fooled: Just because they look "ugly" doesn't mean they come cheap. Some of the most Insta-friendly sneakers are by high-end labels like Balenciaga, Chanel and Louis Vuitton, and come with $1,000-plus (~R12,600) price tags. Luckily, if you're into the ugly-sneaker look, Fila and Nike have a few on-trend (and more affordable) options, too.
