The 93rd annual Comrades Marathon is upon us and on June 10, 2018, approximately 20 000 runners will test their bodies to the limit as they participate in 'The Ultimate Human Race'. This year the race will be a down run from Pietermaritzburg to Durban (Moses Mabhida Stadium) over an excruciating 89-kilometre distance.   The 2018 edition has already seen 21 213 entries for the race and if the motto of 'Asijiki' is adhered to they will all be in attendance - it translates as 'no turning back'. The competition is rich in history, with the latest chapter to be written on Saturday. Here are seven things you probably didn't know about the Comrades Marathon.
