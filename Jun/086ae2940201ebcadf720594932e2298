This year's instalment of the BET Awards may have come and gone, but Africa's representation was without a doubt a highlight we will remember for a long time. Sjava took home the International Viewers' Choice award for Best New Act, while Nigeria's Davido walked away with the Best International Act award on the night. On the fashion front, African stars also came through flying our flags high while rubbing shoulders with international stars. This year's theme was "Blackanda". Here's how South African stars looked:   Nomzamo Mbatha:   Mufasa at #BETAwards2018  Blackanda #betawards2018 Colour @mintysfabrics   We did it again @casperdesigner !!!
