Lee-Roy Jason's new collection of photographs serves to merge politics, societal issues and art. The photographer showcased his stellar pictures, taken over a period of five years, on Thursday night in an exhibition entitled "Everything Must Fall". "It's based on four struggles I have identified as youth struggles ... Just because apartheid has been abolished, doesn't mean that the current struggles no longer exist," he told HuffPost at a cosy venue in Braamfontein. He said the pictures fall into four categories: #FeesMustFall, #ZumaMustFall, #GenderMustFall and #TheWarOnWomen — which includes rape and femicide. #everythingmustfall I can't wait for you to my series.
