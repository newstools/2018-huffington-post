The "Star Wars" galaxy just shrank. Lucasfilm has put plans "on hold" for more spinoff films like "Solo: A Star Wars Story", Collider reported on Wednesday. Citing "sources with knowledge of the situation", the entertainment news site said the franchise will laser in on "Star Wars: Episode IX" and the next trilogy that springs from the original core of movies. That means reported plans for Obi-Wan and Boba Fett movies are apparently cosmic dust for now, according to Collider. The "Star Wars" trend of its films making money hand-over-fist came to a somewhat crashing end with the release of "Solo: A Star Wars Story". The spinoff had a disappointing three-day opening weekend total of $84.4-million (~R1.16-billion), and suffered a 65 percent plummet in box office the following weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. The film came in fourth in the latest ticket-sales list, and has made $196-million (~R2.69-billion) domestically and $147-million (R2.02-billion) internationally as of June 19. "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" raked in a relatively healthy $155-million (~R2.13-billion) on its opening weekend when it premiered in December 2016, and has earned more than $1-billion (~R13.75-billion) worldwide.
