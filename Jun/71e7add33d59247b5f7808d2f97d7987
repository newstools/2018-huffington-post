A dad found himself in an awkward situation when his four-year-old daughter surprised him and his wife by asking why there was a bra in the car. Twitter user ManSitChoAzzDown shared the conversation he had with his daughter on Twitter. "Mummy, why is your bra in daddy's car?" the little girl asked him. "Me: 'What!?' The Mrs hit me with a killer side eye. She ain't been in my car in weeks," he tweeted. "Me: 'Ain't no bra in my car!' Kid: 'Ya huh, cup thingie with straps'." The family all go to the garage to look in the car and are faced with this: The hilarious mix-up went down pretty well on Twitter, as it had more than 140,000 likes and 50,000 comments.
