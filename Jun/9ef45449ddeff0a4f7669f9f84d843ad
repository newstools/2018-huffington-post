A man in his forties was shot in the hand during what appeared to be a cash-in-transit heist in Hillbrow, Johannesburg on Tuesday. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that when the paramedics arrived on the scene, a man who is believed to be the driver of a small truck was found with a gunshot wound in the hand. "He explained to paramedics that his vehicle was behind the security vehicle when a shot was fired and entered his vehicle through the dashboard," Meiring said. He was treated on the scene and later transported to a nearby hospital for further care. No further injuries were reported. Police were unable to immediately confirm the heist. News24
