A photo of Zimbabwean finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, cutting a ribbon at a ceremony, reportedly in Rupase, northeast of the country, has gone viral, for all the right reasons -- depending on how you look at it. The photo was taken over the weekend when Chinamasa was in the area for the opening of a new multisports complex in the town.  According to Zimbabwean publication ZwNews, the launch is in line with the health ministry's bid to promote a cleaner environment in the country following a series of disease breakouts.  Reacting to the picture, people had mixed feelings. But many took it just one step further... in came the #ChinamasaChallenge. Twitter users soon shared photos of themselves launching all sorts of things from beds to study books, condoms, you name it. Sigh!     But the minister could not be bothered if a report in one on H-Metro is anything to go by.
