Every once in a while, South African and American Twitter meet and when they do, things often end up being messy. South African entertainer Lasizwe and American vine star Jay Versace got into a little "disagreement" on Thursday after Jay accused Lasizwe of copying his content. READ: Americans Trolled Da Les, And Mzansi (Kinda) Came To The Rescue It all started when Lasizwe tweeted this video: That one Friend!!! 💔🤬 who doesn't answer!!!

Retweet ✨😏 pic.twitter.com/gNHLiElpxo  Jay wasted no time accusing Lasizwe of copying "everything" he does: boy you copy everything I do https://t.co/jaxXHgQ8oN  But Lasizwe hit back also adding that he was flattered that Jay follows his videos: I don't..., but it's flattering to know that you follow everything that I do ✨💪❤️ https://t.co/Px8O53M4UM  And it was not over yet: lmao I don't know anything about you. ppl keep sending me your corresponding flop ass videos. you're making money off other people's shit and that's fucked up. dig in that big funky ass head of yours and find some of your own shit to post. i'm no longer entertaining this goodbye https://t.co/WV0q8uwmag  uyazi uneDrama Bhuti weGrowth eKanda, I'll keep posting my "flop ass videos" which clearly keep your followers entertained and my pocket lined.

Others defended the 19-year-old: Dear @JAYVERSACE

It's content, you guys are talking about him.
As for copying we've been copying Americans for years, perfect example your Favourite SA rapper.
😂😂😂😂 SA Should be defending him and not feel embarrassed?!?  Some further accused him of stealing their ideas: @JAYVERSACE

He did the same thing to me few months back.
Copied a video of mine and when i called him out he blocked me but then had so much to say when i couldnt see his tweets.Then i got invited onto a radio show he is part of to explain my side of the story.

I declined.  Copy pic.twitter.com/TVjrXeSrHQ   NOTE: Lasizwe has been asked that questions be emailed to him. He'd not responded at the time of publishing.
