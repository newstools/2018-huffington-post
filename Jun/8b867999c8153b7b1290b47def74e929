Media personality Bonang Matheba says she is having a formal gala dinner on Tuesday evening to celebrate her birthday... again. The TV presenter, who turned 31 on Monday, has already had two parties to mark her birthday — the first celebration was on Saturday night at Sandton's Taboo nightclub. On Sunday, she had her second — a garden family luncheon designed by none other than Precious the Planner, aka Precious Tumisho Thamaga, who also planned Bonang's big 30th birthday celebration last year.
