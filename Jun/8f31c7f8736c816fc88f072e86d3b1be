EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu is being criticised widely for a racial attack on Treasury deputy director-general Ismail Momoniat — but this is not the first time the party's chief whip has come under fire for racist remarks — or acts of violence. Business Day reported that during a heated exchange on Tuesday in Parliament's finance committee meeting, Shivambu objected to a Momoniat's repeated appearances on behalf of Treasury, on the grounds that he is "not an African". EWN reported that Shivambu alleges his comments were not racist.

"It's emphatically a fact that will never be withdrawn."  This is not the first time Shivambu has found himself in hot water over similar remarks. In 2012, Shivambu was suspended from the ANC for three years after contravening the ANC's constitution — his comments made to journalists were among the contraventions.

The incident took place within the parliamentary precinct in Cape Town, when De Kock approached Shivambu for comment and snapped pictures of the MP. The EFF labelled the assault a "scuffle", and Shivambu apologised.
