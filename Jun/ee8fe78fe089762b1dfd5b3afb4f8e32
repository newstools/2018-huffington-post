  Despite every England supporter saying they wouldn't get carried away with the World Cup and over-hype Gareth Southgate's team's chances, it took precisely 10 ten minutes for just that to happen. When captain Harry Kane prodded England into the lead over little-fancied Tunisia, the floodgates opened. As the young team threw caution to the wind, adopting an attacking style that is seldom deployed by the national side, Twitter's higher-ups were cooing. Drama. Tunisia were awarded a penalty in the 33rd minute when Kyle Walker conceded what was repeatedly described as a 'soft pen'. Including Tunisia's 'robust' defending against Kane. The Video Assistant Referee system, already established as the pantomime villain of the tournament.
