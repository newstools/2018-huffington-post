In Canada, they get kids started on hockey early. And sometimes, they start themselves on it early. Three-year-old Eli Graveline is one such example. An old baby monitor video of him ‚Äî captured last year when he was two ‚Äî is making its rounds on social media after his mum, Julianne Foisy Graveline, shared it on an Instagram page she made for her son to look at when he grew up. #tbt to mini me, back when my rink was a little bit smaller but my passion was just as strong. . #2y3m #cribadventures #cribhockey #babylife #babyeli #imsocute #hockeykids #hockeytoddlers #obsessedwithhockey #futurehockeyplayer #timbitshockey #toddlersofinstagram #sonofagun #hockeyisforeveryone #hockeylife #sudburyontario #sudbury #rhptraining #sudburysaturdaynight #hockeynightincanada #outdoorhockey #outdoorrink #ownthemoment #ccmhockey #hockeylove #icehockeyaddicts #hockey4kids #hockeyplayer_featured #nhldraft A post shared by  Eli Jett (@eli.jett.173) on Jun 21, 2018 at 4:07am PDT  The charming video shows Eli up in his crib, with a tiny stick in hand, deftly training with a roll of hockey tape in the dark. Why were the stick and tape in his crib to begin with? "He didn't want to let go," Foisy Graveline told CBC News. "He'll still go to bed with a hockey stick every now and then."

The video has been shared by TSN, NBC and many other outlets, with commenters cooing over the adorable tot. Eli's skills have definitely improved since the January 2017 video. Another clip posted to Instagram on Sunday shows him handling a puck with ease before giggling and launching it at his mum. "This ones going to hit you in the face" ‚úÖ - The moment my mom learnt to NEVER doubt my aim again. ü§£ . #hockeykids #hockeytoddlers #obsessedwithhockey #futurehockeyplayer #timbitshockey #toddlersofinstagram #sonofagun #hockeyisforeveryone #hockeylife #sudburyontario #sudbury #rhptraining #sudburysaturdaynight #hockeynightincanada #outdoorhockey #outdoorrink #ownthemoment #ccmhockey #hockeylove #icehockeyaddicts #hockey4kids #hockeyplayer_featured #3y8m #bauerhockey #cribhockey A post shared by  Eli Jett (@eli.jett.173) on Jun 24, 2018 at 4:45am PDT  The caption on another older video, which shows him trying out skates for the first time, says he's been going to ice skating practice for nine months and can zoom around the rink with ease. I ESCAPED THE CRIB! First time on skates. . Wow!! These last 24 hours have been UNREAL to say the least. I've been myself on tv a few times, moms been interviewed many times, we've been invited to skate at the @mastercardcentre (maybe with some @mapleleafs or @torontomarlies players??), we've been offered swag and hockey lessons!! #pinchme! Moms most asked question is "what happened after that video, did he learn to skate?". YES! Mom and dad bought me skates in September 2017 and here's how I played for a month, before ever hitting the ice. I walked on carpet first, then graduated to laminate and ceramic flooring... THEN on to the cold stuff! Being on skates every day (at least 2-3 times/day) helped me gain strength in my ankles and practice my balance. I started hockey lessons three days before my third birthday, and haven't missed a practice in 9 months. THAT's how you learn to skate. üëäüèª . #learntoskate #hockeykids #hockeytoddlers #obsessedwithhockey #futurehockeyplayer #timbitshockey #toddlersofinstagram #sonofagun #hockeyisforeveryone #hockeylife #sudburyontario #sudbury #rhptraining #sudburysaturdaynight #hockeynightincanada #outdoorhockey #outdoorrink #ownthemoment #ccmhockey #hockeylove #icehockeyaddicts #hockey4kids #hockeyplayer_featured #3y8m #bauerhockey #cribhockey A post shared by  Eli Jett (@eli.jett.173) on Jun 23, 2018 at 3:01am PDT  And sometimes he just gets tired.

She and her husband wouldn't describe themselves as hockey fanatics by any means. They don't watch it at home very often and didn't think they would sign him up for any organised sports before his interest blossomed. "I don't know where he got this from, other than just being a northerner, I guess!" she told CBC News. He picked up his first stick while visiting his grandparents, Foisy Graveline told Global News. After noticing his intense interest, his parents finally bought him a stick to have at home. "Now we're at the point we kind of just have to surrender to the fact we will be at the arena every weekend, we will be travelling and we will definitely be, 'hockey parents'," she told Global News. Got to skate with the older gang tonight at @rhptrainingcentre. . #hockeykids #hockeytoddlers #obsessedwithhockey #futurehockeyplayer #timbitshockey #toddlersofinstagram #sonofagun #hockeyisforeveryone #hockeylife #sudburyontario #sudbury #rhptraining #sudburysaturdaynight #hockeynightincanada #outdoorhockey #outdoorrink #ownthemoment #ccmhockey #hockeylove #icehockeyaddicts #hockey4kids A post shared by  Eli Jett (@eli.jett.173) on Jun 5, 2018 at 4:14pm PDT  Eli's next steps are to start actually playing hockey with a league and team once he's a little bit older. Since he's already fairly skilled with a stick and puck, unlike many beginner players, his mum is looking into putting him a year or two up so that he can be challenged. "We're trying to balance pushing him too much versus putting in a group of kids where he won't feel challenged. He definitely likes being challenged," Foisy Graveline said. We see an NHL draft in his future. Also on HuffPost:
