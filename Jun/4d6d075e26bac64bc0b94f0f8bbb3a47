As the Disney parks gear up for an inevitably busy summer, we wanted to take a peek at what all the fun attractions looked like years ago. We rounded up magical photos from Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Disney World in Orlando, Florida, throughout the years. The images feature children on Disneyland's opening day, celebrities enjoying their time at the parks, and rides and decor that definitely look a lot different now. Check out 25 old-school photos of Disney parks below.
