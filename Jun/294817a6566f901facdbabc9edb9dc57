Is there really such a thing as an ugly dog? Judges at the 2018 World’s Ugliest Dog contest in Petaluma, California, answered that question by crowning a 9-year-old bulldog named Zsa Zsa the ugliest of them all. Zsa Zsa, rescued from a Missouri puppy mill, now calls Anoka, Minnesota, home. “She was a puppy mill dog for five years in Missouri, sent to a dog auction and later purchased by Underdog Rescue,” said her owners, Megan and Jesse Brainard, according to the Ugliest Dog contest webpage. “From the moment we saw her beautiful face, we knew we would be her forever home. We are so excited for her, she deserves this.” Zsa Zsa beat out 13 other competitors to take home a trophy and a $1,500 check at Saturday’s competition.  Congratulations to the 2018 #WorldsUgliestDog Contest WINNER Zsa Zsa! Charming the judges with her beauty and talent Zsa Zsa pulled in front of the pack, taking this year’s crown at the #SonomaMarinFair! @pawscouttag pic.twitter.com/pVAXgT3BzZ Share this slide:
