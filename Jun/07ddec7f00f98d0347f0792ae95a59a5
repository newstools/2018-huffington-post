Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson lived up to his wrestling name when his partner Lauren Hashian needed a helping hand while breastfeeding their youngest child, two-month-old Tiana "Tia" Gia. Johnson shared a photo of himself spoon feeding Hashian as she cradled Tia, with the caption: "I'll handle this business 😉💪🏾 "So much respect to her and all mamas out there holding it down and running things." A post shared by therock (@therock) on Jun 10, 2018 at 3:53pm PDT Johnson played up the chivalrous nature of his gesture by getting down on one knee and poking fun at himself with the hashtag #ChivalryIsToughOnTheKnees. Mums commented on the photo to share their own experience of just how time-consuming feeding a baby can be. One wrote: "From one breastfeeding mama to another... I remember those times well, now I manage to get some food between times, teamwork." While another shared the photo with her partner and wrote: "Do you remember doing this for me?! Seems so long ago now doesn't it!" Johnson also has a 16-year-old daughter Simone from a previous marriage and two-year-old Jasmine with Lauren. The couple announced Tia's birth in April, and we've noticed she's already got an eye for the camera. A post shared by Lauren Hashian (@laurenhashianofficial) on Apr 27, 2018 at 11:06am PDT
