Chrissy Teigen continues to keep things honest on Instagram. The supermodel, cookbook author, TV host mom shared a revealing photo of herself getting a Gwyneth Paltrow-approved "vagina steam" treatment on Monday. "Face mask / heat pad / vagina steam no I don't know if any of this works but it can't hurt right? *vagina dissolves*" Teigen captioned the picture, which showed her doing all three of the treatments at once. A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jun 18, 2018 at 9:24pm PDT In case you're interested in emulating Teigen's trendy steam, Jennifer Gunter, a San Francisco-based OB/GYN and writer, advised caution. "Claims that ['vaginal steams' or 'cleanses'] can somehow impact vaginal or uterine health are not biologically plausible," Gunter said in 2016. "A vagina does not need to be detoxed. Ever. The vagina is a self-cleaning oven. That is why we have good bacteria." Teigen has been on a social media realness streak since giving birth to her second child with John Legend, a baby boy named Miles, in May. Shortly after welcoming her son, she shared a photo of herself wearing postpartum mesh underwear and holding Miles, as her daughter, Luna, plays in the background. A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on May 20, 2018 at 9:04pm PDT She also opened up about the horror of a postpartum ripped butthole and thanked Miles for keeping hers intact. "I can confirm postpartum life is 90% better when you don't rip to your butthole. Baby boy: 1 point. Luna: 0," Teigen wrote shortly after giving birth. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of Teigen and Legend's son.
