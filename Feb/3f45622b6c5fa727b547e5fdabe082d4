Doctor-turned-entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong, who was born in South Africa to Chinese parents, has reached a deal to buy the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune â€” just another feather in his already impressive cap of successes. Soon-Shiong stepped in at a critical time for the struggling newspapers, who have cut staff by half in the face of dropping circulation numbers. The Los Angeles Times' new owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, just sent his first letter to our newsroom: pic.twitter.com/KwD5J92e4t  "We need newspapers," he said. "We need this intellectual integrity.
