NGO Gift of the Givers has started an initiative in which it will be drilling boreholes all over the drought-stricken Western Cape. The organisation has been given a donation of R200,000 towards the project by Microsoft, with a proviso to ensure that poor areas are prioritised. "We wanted to work with [Gift of the Givers] specifically... to make sure we can create a sustainable water source," Microsoft chief marketing and operations officer Kethan Parbhoo said. "In some of our research, we found [that] once you work with an NGO that is credible ... the city of Cape Town was comfortable," he added. Gift of the Givers Imtiaz Sooliman told HuffPost that it was a step in the right direction, because it will help "create a more sustainable solution for the drought in Western Cape". "A contribution towards a borehole is far more efficient and sustainable in the long run," Sooliman added.
