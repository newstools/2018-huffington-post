Good evening. *** ANC WELCOMES CHANGES TO THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT The African National Congress (ANC) notes and welcomes the changes to the National Executive of the Republic of South Africa announced today by the President, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa. President Ramaphosa, exercised his constitutional responsibilities, in line with Section 91 of the constitution to appoint the Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers. As the ANC, we particularly commend the President for having exercised this prerogative in consultation with the National Officials of the ANC and our Alliance Partners. Undoubtedly, this act of giving due regard to the resolutions of the African National Congress, in the exercise of the prerogative bestowed upon the President, lays a strong foundation for greater alignment and cooperation between the ANC and its cadres deployed in government. The ANC congratulates Deputy President-elect Comrade David Mabuza as well as all comrades appointed and intended to be appointed Ministers and Deputy Ministers. We assure them of the organisation's support in the execution of their duties. We extend our gratitude to all comrades who served in the immediate past Cabinet and are confident that they and their skills are not lost to the ANC. The ANC is confident that, as disciplined members of the organization, they will continue to serve the movement and the people of South Africa in whatever capacity they are deployed. *** IS RAMAPHOSA KEEPING MOKONYANE? EFF leader Julius Malema says Nomvula Mokonyane is staying in Cabinet and possibly being moved to the department of communications. But she's all but crippled and destroyed the department of water and sanitation. Check out ace City Press reporter Sipho Masondo run the rule over Mokonyane here. *** JULIUS THE ORACLE? EFF leader Julius Malema is normally not far from being off the mark. He tweeted that Malusi Gigaba (finance) and Nomvula Mokonyane (water and sanitation) are staying. Really? How do you keep Gigaba of all the people and talk about fight against state capture?  What makes Nomvula survive all the time? Now going to communications  *** GAME OVER FOR FIKILE? Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula seemingly has let the cat out of the bag. He's changed his Twitter name to "ANC Elections Chair". It previously said "MinisterFear Fokkol". See for yourself: President Ramaphosa, Is going to ANNOUNCE cabinet changes in a few hours . I HAVE PACKED ALREADY LETS MOVE ON ......  Am ready to be reconsidered... *** Ramaphosa has been adamant that the ANC and government need to be punctual... so the postponement is not going down well in some quarters... Ramapostponer is postponing again from 8:30 to 9:30 pm. And this is the man who promised us punctuality!  *** The ANC's new deputy president is a mysterious man, embroiled in countless allegations and controversies dating back almost 10 years. From millions of rands stashed in his home and having a private army, to being behind political assassinations in Mpumalanga – the cloud hanging over Mabuza's head is dark; very dark. Read about Mabuza's ghosts here. *** In a strategic powerplay, David Mabuza has been propelled to national significance but an analysis of his history will show that he wrote the playbook of political chicanery that Zuma deploys. He was elected deputy president of the ANC in December and has indicated that he will soon resign as premier of Mpumalanga. But who is he? Read more here. **** There are 35 ministers in Cabinet. HuffPost had a look at who deserves to get the boot – and maybe as many as 20, 25 ministers deserve to be dropped. HuffPost's list is conservative – there are easily 10 more ministers that should pack up their executive offices before the state of the nation address. Ramaphosa will be itching for change, but he'll be wary of too much blood on the floor. Check it out here. *** #CabinetReshuffle announcement has been delayed. It will now start at 21h30.  *** President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce changes to his Cabinet at 20:30. UPDATE: A 1-hour delay has been announced The announcement was made by the presidency at 19:30. *** President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce changes to the National Executive at 8.30pm tonight [now delayed to 9.30pm], Monday 26 February 2018, in a statement to media at The Presidency, Union Buildings, Pretoria.
