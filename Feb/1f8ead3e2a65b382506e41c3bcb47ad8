Apparently Oprah Winfrey’s favorite Starbucks is located under a rock. In an interview released this week, Winfrey and her “A Wrinkle in Time” co-stars Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling talked to E! News about the errands they run ― including whether they get their own coffee at Starbucks. Witherspoon and Winfrey said they do, prompting Kaling to ask: “Can you imagine writing ‘Oprah’ on a coffee cup?” Winfrey actually had a very amusing anecdote about just that. “Oh my god! I just went two days ago!” she said. “And the woman said, ‘Name?’ And I said, ‘Oprah.’ And she said … ‘How do you spell that?’” When did Mariah Carey start working at Starbucks?
