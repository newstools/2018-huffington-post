NBA star LeBron James just delivered a blunt message for Fox News’ Laura Ingraham. Earlier this week, the “Ingraham Angle” host had criticized Cleveland Cavaliers player James and Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant over a video in which James called out President Donald Trump for not giving “a fuck about the people.” Ingraham told the athletes to “shut up and dribble” and to “keep the political commentary to yourself.” On Friday evening, James responded with this tweet: #wewillnotshutupanddribble https://t.co/LyenGRKTUE He signaled his intention not to stand down with the hashtag #wewillnotshutupanddribble. Ingraham replied soon after with this invite: Hey King, Come play on my Court next week. You’re invited on the show anytime. https://t.co/CpXRl5jGzQ James has yet to RSVP. Other sports stars had chimed in against Ingraham over the past week, including the Miami Heat’s Dwyane Wade and recent Super Bowl LII winner Chris Long of the Philadelphia Eagles. I’ll be replying to my own tweet with a collage of your network allowing political commentary from a few folks. https://t.co/WUGl1WQSLE They use to try and hide it.. now the president has given everyone the courage to live their truths. https://t.co/OwLSMHIG0m
