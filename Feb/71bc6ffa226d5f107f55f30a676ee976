Famous for designing the most expensive house ever sold in South Africa (for a whopping R290-million in 2016), Cape Town's SAOTA Architects are known for their luxurious touch, and ability to make even the gaudiest request seem architecturally necessary. The firm, lead by Stefan Antoni, Philip Olmesdahl, Greg Truen, Phillippe Fouché and Mark Bullivant, has since become one of the world's most popular architectural firms – with built and drafted projects going on in all four corners of the globe, and all of them for figures that would make your eyes water.

The architects said in a statement that the house created, "a landscape of experience". Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
