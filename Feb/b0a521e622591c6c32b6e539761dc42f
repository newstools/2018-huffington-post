Last week, 955 miners were trapped at a Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in Welkom following an electric-cable outage during a storm. The two 132kV lines supplying mines in the Welkom area collapsed due to a severe storm, leaving mines in the area without electricity supply. All of the miners were eventually rescued.
