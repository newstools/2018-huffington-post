Police minister Fikile Mbalula is at it again – posting on Twitter that he is "not afraid of anything" following the swearing-in of Cyril Ramaphosa as president on Thursday afternoon. Mna am not afraid of anything I can b reshuffled recalled anything am not unemployable Shame! Andoyiki I serve at the behest of the President and THE ANC...  SA Twitter wasted no time replying and telling Mbalula he protests too much.   pic.twitter.com/o0LfIXuEhm      Mara deep down, uyazi uzonya tsotsi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/bzntpBUEvb  Of course, there were a few supporters ready to stroke his ego...  But I must say justice in South Africa has changed you've done a good job  Uyizamile nokho SAPS👏 I support Rama's camp and everyone against state capture a d corruption but would be disappointed if you could be removed.    It didn't end there. Mbalula, despite the tsunami of crime in which too many South Africans are drowning, still found time in his busy police-minister schedule to post another tweet – claiming to have been a brave anti-Zuma voice all along. I opposed President Zuma in mangaung he didn't reshuffle ME, Dont ask me Why? Cde President Ramaphosa must choose his team and move on.We need to focus on winning the election  Well, SA Twitter wasn't going to let that pass without comment... "I opposed President Zuma in Mangaung he didn't reshuffle me"🤔 is that your way of asking Ramaphosa not to reshuffle you as you made it clear that NDZ will be next President of the ANC not CR? pic.twitter.com/Eclu8b7dv7  That wont work Bro, You throwing sympathy card, Ramaphosa is wise, you will be minister of security guards.  Don't try to act smart " APRIL'' we know you don't want to be reshuffled  When you were campaigning for NDZ people told you that you standing on the wrong side of the history but you didn't listen, ANC must recall you!   Mbalula's tweets come as Cabinet-reshuffle rumours do the rounds ahead of President Ramaphosa's state of the nation speech on Friday night. No doubt he can find a portfolio for Mbaks, even if he loses the police gig. Minister of social media buffoonery?  South Africa's new First Lady Dr Tshepo (Motsepe) Ramaphosa wearing #ThulaSindi 🤗as one does 😎 pic.twitter.com/42WRvYFM4K  Eish Comrade Peter

We want a State of the Nation Address this evening and we're ready.
