In Monday night's Cabinet reshuffle, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Bheki Cele as the new minister of police, and Twitter has been blazing ever since.  Some very excited tweeps warned overweight policeman that they would now have to lose weight to conform to Cele's "stomach-in-chest-out" philosophy. The police minister's anti-potbelly remarks were made when he was the police commissioner in 2010. He told officers that "people must envy your body".   At some point #BhekiCele asked Baby Jake Matlala to train police to reduce "umkhaba" says Prof Somadoda Fikeni
I didn't know this 😂😂 #amlive  His comments were posted on YouTube, and inspired a techno hit that synchronised his speech with dance beats.  Volkswagen Polo (VW) drivers – whose cars are prime theft and hijacking targets – are said to be at ease, now that Cele will be steering the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) ship.

vs #BhekiCele as Minister Of Police#CabinetReshuffle pic.twitter.com/MbExytazjz  Others, less impressed with his appointment, reminded us that former public protector Thuli Madonsela, while still in the position, found that Cele's conduct was improper while he was police commissioner. In 2011, Madonsela determined that Cele had unlawfully entered into a R500-million lease for the Sanlam Middestad Building in Pretoria. He was subsequently fired.  Someone please remind me why #BhekiCele was fired from the police ministry under President Zuma? #CabinetReshuffle cc. @Julius_S_Malema  This is what #ThuliMadonsela said about #BhekiCele

"His conduct was improper, unlawful and amounted to maladministration"

This is when he was Police Commissioner, now he is the Minister In Charge of Police!!! 😳😳😳😳#CabinetReshuffle I don't understand why would people be happy about #BhekiCele when he was removed because of corruption from the same position! another thing he brought with him Amabherete who terrorized our hoods and innocent people instead of criminals #CabinetReshuffle I think this excitement over #BhekiCele is misplaced. Have we forgotten why the man was fired?😏. Bheki Cele is a reckless populist who is all about bravado and a show of force, at a time when our Police Services need strong intelligence more than anything.
