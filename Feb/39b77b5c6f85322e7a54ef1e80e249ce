Phahlane's wife, Brigadier Beauty Phahlane, and car dealer Durand Snyman, are also due in court. Phahlane allegedly accepted bribes in order to secure tenders for police suppliers. It is alleged that Phahlane and his wife received cars from Snyman in exchange for securing tenders for forensic equipment suppliers, which Phahlane claims were sponsored vehicles.
