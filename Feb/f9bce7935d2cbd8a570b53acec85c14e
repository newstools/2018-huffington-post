It has been raining babies in South African Celebville and across the world – and celebrity parents are coming up with the most outlandish baby names.  Here are the most outlandish ones we have heard in recent times: 1. "Panther" – Skhumba Hlophe   South African comedian Skhumba Hlophe was recently blessed with his third child. Of the kid's three names, "Panther" caught our eye – or is it just a nickname? Myself and Dibakiso we're blessed with a Baby Boy this Morning at 7h53am.......Snakhokonke Reatile "Panther" Hlophe .......... #Blessed A post shared by  Skhumba (@skhumba_official) on Feb 19, 2018 at 11:58pm PST  Whether Skhumba was inspired the film "Black Panther" or not, local celebrities are getting adventurous with baby names. 2. "Star Phoenix Ivy" – Nonhle Thema   Remember Nonhle Thema? It seems the last time she was in the celebrity spotlight was a lifetime ago, but she outdid Jay-Z and Beyoncé when she named her baby girl "Star Phoenix Ivy". We bet the kid reverts to "Ivy" for most of her school career... Today my Star is turning 5 😍 Happy Birthday my Princess. .Thank you for the beautiful cake @cakes_by_tshego 😍😍 the kids love it 😙😙 A post shared by  Nonhle Thema 😇👑💖 (@nonhle_thema) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:03am PDT  3. "Golden" – Nick Cannon   Nick Cannon had his third child – and first with former Miss Arizona Brittany Bell – in 2017: son "Golden Sagon" Cannon. Seriously – "Golden"? Cannon, who split with longtime partner Mariah Carey after they had two daughters together, is obviously now living, ahem... gilt-free... "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights" Welcome to the world Golden "Sagon" Cannon #nickcannon #newbaby A post shared by  Nick Cannon Archives (@ncannonarchives) on Feb 22, 2017 at 9:14pm PST   4. "Apple" – Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin   Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin took a lot of flak for naming their daughter "Apple" – and perhaps they deserved it. It's a sweet, satisfying name for hippie parents being cute, but a weird name is a great way to put a target on a kid's back in the school playground. Perhaps Apple and her brother, Moses, have tutors. 5. "North", "Saint" and "Chicago" – Kanye West and Kim Kardashian   "North", "Saint" and "Chicago"? All combined with "West"? Sounds more like directions or bohemian bar names – Kim and Yeezy's brood had better be home-schooled too. 6. "Dream" – Black Chyna and Rob Kardashian   Unfortunately for Rob and Black Chyna, their infamously bad relationship fell apart before their child was born. So maybe "Dream" got her bizarre name as a memory of a fantasy that couldn't last... 7. "Puma" – Erykah Badu   RnB and neosoul legend Erykah Badu has a daughter named "Puma" – hopefully she grows up fearless and feisty like her mum, rather than being oddly drawn to sportswear...
