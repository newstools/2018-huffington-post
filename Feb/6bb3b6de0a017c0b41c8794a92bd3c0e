A new vegan documentary led by an Oscar-winning team aims to challenge stereotypes about vegan diets versus those that include meat. Executive producer James Cameron ("Titanic", "Avatar") and director Louis Psihoyos ("The Cove") helmed "The Game Changers", a documentary that claims to expose health drawbacks that many believe can be caused by a meat-based diet. James Wilks, winner of The Ultimate Fighter and a special forces trainer, speaks to some leading athletes, soldiers and experts about the impact of meat-eating regimes on their health. Icons like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Olympic silver medallist Dotsie Bausch and professional strongman Patrik Baboumian tell Wilks about the meat-heavy diets they used to build muscle, and their transition to a vegan diet, which they say has since affected every aspect of their lives. The documentary received high praise after its debut screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Its supporters reckon it busts many a myth about the effects of a vegan diet and the alleged health implications of eating meat. The release date of "The Game Changers" is yet to be announced.
