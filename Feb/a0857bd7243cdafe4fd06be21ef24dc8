It's okay to be optimistic about President Cyril Ramaphosa, but it would be naive but it would be naive to trust those in the ANC who who fought for and defended his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. This according to former Business Day editor and now ABSA's head of communications, Songezo Zibi, who in a series of tweets, recalled an experience in Parliament with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.    He warned that such members of the ANC may not share Ramaphosa's vision. Zibi said these members drove South Africa to the "brink of institutional and political collapse".   He said the ANC needs to atone for the "destruction" caused by its choice in electing Zuma.     Do you agree, disagree or have an alternative view?
