Kylie Jenner announced via Instagram on Tuesday that she has named her first child Stormi. It is Jenner’s first child with her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott. The 20-year-old reality star and beauty mogul announced on Sunday that she’d given birth to a daughter on Feb. 1 after months of speculation around her suspected pregnancy. A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Feb 6, 2018 at 1:14pm PST “Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Kylie wrote in her Sunday announcement. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!” In addition to her message, Jenner posted a sweet, 11-minute video, called “To Our Daughter,” that shared moments from the past nine months. There were a few butterfly references in the video (Jenner wears a butterfly chain and there were butterflies on what looked like the walls of the nursery). Many fans speculated that Kylie would name her daughter Butterfly, Mariposa (which means “butterfly” in Spanish) or Monarch, after Scott’s song “Butterfly Effect.” Jenner and Scott also have matching butterfly tattoos. Kris Jenner told People magazine at an event in Los Angeles on Monday night that Kylie is “an amazing mom.” “God is SO good!!” the momager said on social media after Kylie announced her baby news Sunday. “I am so excited and thrilled to welcome another precious baby girl to our beautiful, ever growing family. We are blessed beyond belief!” This post has been updated with more background about the baby announcement.
