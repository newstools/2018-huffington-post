North Korea may have 22 athletes competing at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, but all eyes are on the country's 229-woman cheer squad. The so-called "army of beauties" wear matching outfits and perform meticulously choreographed cheers when North Korean athletes compete.   Their cheers are pretty standard, according to translators at The Washington Post. The women are singing traditional songs and chanting phrases like "go team" and "our home country, unite!" But some onlookers think the "official government enthusiasm" is creepy. Hate to be a downer, but this seems exactly like what you'd expect of a "cheer squad" from a totalitarian country. Official government enthusiasm. https://t.co/L6VOkRN6zf  North Korea cheer-squad is truly super creepy #pyeongchangOlympics2018 pic.twitter.com/r98l0nIejN  This is North Korea's ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ #Olympics Cheer Squad

The women had promised to view the South as "enemy territory," a South Korean newspaper reported, citing unnamed defectors from the North. With files from The Associated Press Also on HuffPost:
