* Note that this article contains true stories of sexual violence and abuse. Girls should be taught to shout and scream! I had a voice, but in every instance, my voice didn't count – it was not loud enough. How long are we to suffer at the hands of misogyny and complacency? I am thirty-nine years old, and I have been raped multiple times and sexually abused countless times from a very young age. My parents were divorced and had their own emotional challenges at the time. Below I have written my experiences – that I could remember – in a very short form, hitting you as the reader as hard as I could for two reasons: catharsis for me, and for you to be encouraged to act – to facilitate change in whatever constructive and effective wayyou can. I still dream about being violated almost every night. It is everywhere... This demon called male violence, its origin misogyny. Its end will be named after the bravest of the brave start talking and make it stop. Those who stand up. Those who support. Those who stop the perpetual cycle of rape.
