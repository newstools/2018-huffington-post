A streaker at the Winter Olympics just wanted to bring “PEACE + LOVE” to the world. The ponytailed man bounded onto the ice shortly after the men’s 1,000 m speedskating event in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Friday. As video that Instagram user mhj.kooij shared online shows, the rink intruder removed his clothes to reveal a pink tutu and a strategically placed sock beneath. A post shared by Maarten Kooij (@mhj.kooij) on Feb 23, 2018 at 3:45am PST He’d inked the message about peace and love onto his chest. Yahoo News identified the man as U.K.-based Mark Roberts, who reportedly has now streaked at more than 500 events ― including Super Bowl XXXVIII. It’s unclear how officials dealt with his impromptu performance, which has now gone down in Olympic history.
