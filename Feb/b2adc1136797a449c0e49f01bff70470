On Monday, Malema tweeted : On Monday, Malema quipped on eNCA that Ramaphosa has surely had his presidential speech prepared since 1994 [when he was still Mandela's preferred successor] – and should just update it at the 2018 Sona, because the EFF plans a "surprise" motion of no confidence in Zuma before the Sona can take place.
