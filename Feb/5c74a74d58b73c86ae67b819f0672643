A plucky squirrel was inches away from meeting its maker at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Saturday morning. Austrian snowboarder Daniela Ulbing narrowly avoided striking the critter after it bounded onto the course during the women’s parallel giant slalom heat. WATCH OUT SQUIRREL. pic.twitter.com/rtQ94MQeDj Perhaps even more incredibly, Ulbing maintained her composure enough to win the race. The close call sparked plenty of reaction on Twitter: You say "Squirrel Avoids Snowboarder," I say "Squirrel Olympics Feature Different Sports" Squirrel runs onto the course in the parallel giant slalom while the athletes are in full flight. #pyeongchang2018It’s alive. Just. pic.twitter.com/ggPMgFz14G Squirrel: "Lemme play! Lemme play" *swoosh*Squirrel: "Run away! Run away!" https://t.co/md9V6iOY9L Close up look of the squirrel. pic.twitter.com/y5T07mlhAt Thats 1 lucky squirrel #PyeongChang2018 Golden medal to the squirrel who almost died!#WinterOlympics
