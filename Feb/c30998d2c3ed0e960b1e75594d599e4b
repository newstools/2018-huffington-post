The Hawks are conducting a raid on the Gupta compound in Saxonwold. The reason for the raid is not clear, and Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi told News24 that a statement will be issued later today.   The road outside the Gupta residence has reportedly been sealed off.   Speculation is rife that the raid is in connection with the Gupta family's alleged involvement in state capture. Coincidentally, President Jacob Zuma is expected to make an announcement on whether or not he will resign from office today.
