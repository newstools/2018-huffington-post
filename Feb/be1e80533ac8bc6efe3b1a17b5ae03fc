My interest in poetry came from my fascination with how words could express and, at the same time, carry the accumulation of our experience(s). The experience could be simple or complex, sad or joyful, despairing or hopeful. It is about how the word(s) looks into me or the other, see in one's recess and express the moment without being held back. Before the flight home lie here with me let me rest my head in your bosom sow when the moment arrives you can fly with me inside your heart do not leave me yet soothe my breasts with the ever gentle circling movements from your hand give me that mouth to mouth aid so I can share the air you inhale stay clasped to me like this so that I can feel the bulge of that masculinity as you perform each individual rite to exorcise my epileptic fits whose rage is tamed in the thick warm stream that flows through us now do not let the big bird fly with you and take you away from me this rite of passage must not end even when dawn comes to take you away   * This is an extract from "Shapes, Shades and Faces" by Moferefere Lekorotsoana.
