  Canadian figure-skating duo Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford went out in style at the Winter Olympics on Thursday. The two cleanly landed the first throw quad salchow in Olympic history during the pairs free skate figure skating, NBC Sports reported. The difficult maneuver enabled the two-time world champions to earn bronze as they presumably finished their Olympic careers.

Duhamel and Radford previously helped Canada win gold in the team event and took silver as part of the team competition at the Sochi Games. Duhamel said their performances in Pyeongchang, South Korea, "just perfectly wrapped up my skating career and my skating journey. I feel so complete right now. I feel like I'm going to be happy for the rest of my life."
