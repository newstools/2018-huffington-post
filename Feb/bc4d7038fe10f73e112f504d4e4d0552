Donald Trump again cried “WITCH HUNT!” on Twitter on Tuesday, apparently referring to Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged collusion between the president’s 2016 campaign and Russian efforts to interfere in the election. It’s a phrase Trump has used before. But many are wondering if he’s using it correctly: A witch hunt is when a movement fueled by prejudice and bereft of material evidence results in bloodlust. Your use of the term here is incorrect. A better example might be if, say, you tried to convince the world that a sitting president wasn’t American simply because he’s black. This witch hunt sure is catching a lot of witches. => Yep, and I suspect there may be a few more waiting in the wings . . . pic.twitter.com/QoiCTFZnpv Worked out really well for the last guy who claimed Witch Hunt. pic.twitter.com/DZkpK3iSmr This is offensive to all witches https://t.co/1l455n1GVc Reminder that Trump supporters seem to think "witch hunt" means being hunted by witches. pic.twitter.com/6arVFvHG5L I hope witches are actually hunting him. It ends with Kushner standing in the basement facing a wall. pic.twitter.com/3jh8MyX7eJ Is this a witch hunt? No. Am I a witch currently using witchcraft to actively hunt the President? Yes. "WITCH HUNT" pic.twitter.com/5Pm9aJbdCW 19 indictments. 7 guilty pleas. So far.I’m starting to think that Trump doesn’t really understand the meaning of the phrase “witch hunt.” WITCH HUNT! pic.twitter.com/YOZ4F8oFxs He’s got 99 problems and witches ain’t one. I know many are also practicing voodoo... pic.twitter.com/M0QBOu7DRz It's not a witch hunt, it's a traitor hunt and Mueller is getting closer all the time. Resign  and move to Russia, if Putin will have you. #1 witch on the list! Congrats for making it to the top! pic.twitter.com/SsDrV0Vomx Share this slide:
