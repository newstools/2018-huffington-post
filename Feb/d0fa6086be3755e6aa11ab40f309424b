Between Black Coffee's Las Vegas residency, Loyiso Madinga's gig on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah" and Ladysmith Black Mambazo's fifth Grammy win, we are convinced that there's no end in sight to the high Mzansi started the year on. It keeps getting better. As the worldwide opening of Marvel's "Black Panther" approaches, following its Los Angeles premiere on January 29, South African entertainers continue to make us proud. On Wednesday, rapper and producer Kendrick Lamar released the tracklist for the soundtrack of the film – and it features South African artists Babes Wodumo and Sjava.

Babes Wodumo pic.twitter.com/ptqOwnNHkx  Of course, someone took jabs at Mampinstha (it is, after all, South African Twitter). We finally get a Babes Wodumo song that DOESN'T feature Mampintsha! pic.twitter.com/ziB9YsM5Tr  BABES WODUMO on the #BlackPantherAlbum without that guy calls for a celebration. May she continued to rise. pic.twitter.com/bJMrkk2obZ   The film premieres in South African cinemas on February 16.
