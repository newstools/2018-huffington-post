Former president Jacob Zuma's farewell function, hosted by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday afternoon, was a jovial occasion, if photos released by the Presidency are anything to go by. The pictures show the former colleagues sharing laughs and chatting, just a week after Zuma begrudgingly resigned as head of state. According to News24, the farewell was attended by various ministers and officials from the presidency. It was arranged to pay tribute to Zuma "for his contribution to South Africa's development during his nine years in office", the Presidency reportedly said. It was all smiles between Zuma and Ramaphosa who, until a little over a week ago, were locked in tense negotiations over the former's removal as head of state.

Lest we forget Mbeki refused to campaign for the ANC for 9 years. Msholozi remains a humble servant of the ANC. Hamba Kahle Nxamalala #ZumaDinner #Unity pic.twitter.com/YAlJZxcbHX
