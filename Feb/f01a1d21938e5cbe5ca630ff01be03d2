Children will be able to explore more than 60 real-life activities and test their skills in variety of professions. Through roleplaying, they can explore different real-life jobs â€“ pilots, journalists, scientists, firemen, broadcasters and many more. The city is a replica of the real world, with streets, buildings, a transport system and a functioning economy.   The first of its kind in South Africa, KidZania is educational entertainment that provides a dynamic way for youngsters to learn and develop essential life skills, while having fun.
