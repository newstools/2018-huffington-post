South African pantsula company Via Sophiatown has finally been confirmed as one of the first African acts to perform at the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi. A statement by the museum this week announced: "Louvre Abu Dhabi will be hosting dynamic dances by South African band Via Sophiatown from April 19-21, combining step-dancing and hip-hop accompanied by three live jazz musicians." The group, which has been touring the world for the past few years, joins an impressive lineup of international acts – like dancers of the Indonesian royal courts, cellist Sonia Wider-Atherton, and dancer Shantala Shivalingappa.
