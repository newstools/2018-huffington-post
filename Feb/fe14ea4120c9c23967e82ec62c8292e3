President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his inaugural state of the nation address (Sona) on Friday evening. His explosive speech was littered with rhetoric promising positive change and was delivered with no interruptions â€” even the EFF sat through the entire speech! Following two weeks of structural changes in the ANC and the country â€” which ultimately led to the resignation of former president Jacob Zuma â€” Ramaphosa made it clear that a "new dawn" was on the horizon for South Africa. Twitter users described Ramaphosa's speech as a sign of hope for the country, while others missed the drama the EFF often brought during Zuma's tenure, where recent Sonas were marked by walk-outs and fiery interruptions.  While some may have been inspired by the shift in South Africa's leadership, many Twitter users craved the hysteria and drama the EFF often caused.  It would seem that free education and unemployment were top of mind for many users.  The clarity regarding free education is highly appreciated Mr President. Atleast now people will not fear applying as 1st Year students, because of lack of moneyðŸ¤— #SONA2018 Missed the full address?
