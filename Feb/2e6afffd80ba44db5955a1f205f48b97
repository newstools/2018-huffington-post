Tensions were high on Monday as protesters descended on Luthuli House in Johannesburg. The protests by supporters of President Jacob Zuma (#HandsOffZuma) and ANC members who want Zuma gone (#ZumaMustGo) are marked by frequent clashes between the factions. Members of Black First Land First (BLF) were chased away by #ZumaMustGo supporters by around 11.30am, which seemingly restored some calm before BLF returned, ruffling feathers anew. It seems the protest comes alive whenever #BLF members come out of nowhere and provoke the ANC members.

Thabang Setona, an ANC branch secretary, said the anti-Zuma camp is tired of "unity", and that they were there to "defend" Luthuli House. He claimed the headquarters were under attack by "the nyaope boys", and said his group was there to protect the leadership-elect of the ANC under Cyril Ramaphosa. Police were stationed a short way from the small group of protesters. Situation slowly gaining momentum at #LuthuliHouse.

@HuffPostSApic.twitter.com/nJ0ukHznos  The protests coincide with growing pressure on the president to resign. Reports at the weekend said that the ANC leadership had met with Zuma to ask him to step down, but no official word had emerged by Monday morning on the outcome of those discussions.
