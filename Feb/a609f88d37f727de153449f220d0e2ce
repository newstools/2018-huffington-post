We bet businessman Vusi Thembekwayo was not ready for the reaction from South Africans when he claimed to have written most of Malusi Gigaba's recent Budget speech. Over the weekend, Thembekwayo addressed a session on board the #SABCTheJourney cruise to the Mozambique islands. During a Q-and-A session, he reportedly said he'd made a significant contribution to the Budget speech. I contributed a lot on the Minister Of Finance speech. A big portion of it I wrote. - @VusiThembekwayo #SABC3TheJourney  There were atleast 15 other people in the room. This is a direct quote.

Furthermore, any suggestions that I have violated Vusi's right to privacy is BS. This was not on some table talk over drinks thing. It was a media Q&A, he said this and I quoted him verbatim.  Following the tweet from Phil Mphela, an entertainment commentator who was in the audience, people could barely hold back. Many had questions for both Thembekwayo and Gigaba. So we should blame him for the VAT increase?!  In what capacity?  Did he also make suggestions on the actual budget ?  @VusiThembekwayo please elaborate. pic.twitter.com/egtRvgnKO2  In came the #OtherThingsVusiWrote... which soon made it to the trends columns. #OtherThingsVusiWrote
