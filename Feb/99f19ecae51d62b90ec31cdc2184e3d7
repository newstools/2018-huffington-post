Crime Has Robbed Us Of Great Talents And It Must Stop Like many on social media, wannabe entertainer Skolopad weighed in on the thread, questioning how events would have played out if "the tables were turned".  People were not having any of it.   Speaking to TshisaLive about her comments, Skolopad said she did not think people would come for her. She said she ignored the sensitivity of the issue, and now understands people's anger. "To be honest, I was just asking an innocent question and I didn't mean to offend anyone. I didn't think that people would attack me personally for a simple question... people just took their anger on me. Maybe the way I asked the question seemed insensitive, but I was just asking," she told the publication. Investigations into Meyiwa's murder continue.
