Retailer Toys R Us has fallen into administration, putting 3,200 jobs at risk. All stores will continue trading until further notice and much of the stock will be subject to clearance discounts and other special promotions. “Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided,” joint administrator Simon Thomas said. “We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. We are grateful for the commitment and hard work of employees as the business continues to trade.” Gift cards and vouchers will be honoured while the stores continue to trade, but customers are being encouraged to redeem vouchers as soon as possible as stores may be subject to closure without notice. No further gift cards will be sold from Wednesday. This is a breaking news story and will be updated. Check back for the fullest version. Follow HuffPost UK on Twitter here, and on Facebook here.
