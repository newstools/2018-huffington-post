The top pet name South Africans like to give their cars? Gugulami, AKA "My Precious". This was revealed in a recent month-long poll by Autotrader, in which South African drivers indicated names they like to whisper to their four-wheeled friends. "Some of the poll results are sweet, some are laugh-out-loud and others are a little wicked," said Angelique Lynch, Autotrader's marketing director.
