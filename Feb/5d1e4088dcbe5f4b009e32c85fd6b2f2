The presidency has denied reports that an agreement has been reached about President Jacob Zuma's future. According to an SABC report on Monday afternoon, Zuma had agreed to step down, adding that the only sticking point is who would communicate the decision: government or the the ANC. BBC news correspondent Milton Nkosi also reported that the ANC had recalled Zuma. In a subsequent tweet, however, he said as a matter of 'clarification' that the ANC national executive committee (NEC) meeting was still ongoing. Although calls for Zuma to step down had been made, he said, there was no official announcement made by the ANC.
