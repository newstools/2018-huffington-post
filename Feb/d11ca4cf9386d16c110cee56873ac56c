Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba's Budget speech, which included a number of tax increases set to deliver South Africa's dream of free higher education, has been met with mixed responses from South Africans. South African students have protested for free education for three consecutive years. Little did they know they would pay for it in other ways. Among the "sin taxes" set to be increased are those on alcohol and cigarettes â€“ and judging by social media, sinners are unhappy. Alcohol and Tobacco excise duties up by between 6% and 10% #BudgetSpeech2018 pic.twitter.com/PdBqY5QBXn  #Budget2018 Rise in alcohol and tobacco increases:
