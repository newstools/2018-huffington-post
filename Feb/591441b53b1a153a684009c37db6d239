To raise money for GEANCO, a group that focuses on improving the health and education for the poor in Africa, Benedict Cumberbatch wants you and a friend to have tea with him, and then see the world premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War” in Los Angeles. If you’re curious as to what having tea with Cumberbatch would be like, the English actor shows us by doing a dramatic performance of the nursery rhyme “I’m a little tea pot.” It’s quite gripping. Cumberbatch, who plays Dr. Stephen Strange ― aka the Sorcerer Supreme ― in the upcoming Marvel film due out May 18, also delights with some fantastically complicated vocal exercises. Come for the nursery rhyme, but stay for his tongue twisting skills.
