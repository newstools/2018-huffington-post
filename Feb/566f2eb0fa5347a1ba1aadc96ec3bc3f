Police in Orlando, Florida say they thwarted a 43-year-old man’s alleged attempt to kidnap pop singer Lana Del Rey. Michael Hunt of Riverview was arrested on Friday evening just a block away from Orlando’s Amway Center, where Del Rey — whose real name is Elizabeth Grant — was scheduled to perform to a crowd of about 8,000 later that night. Hunt, who faces charges of attempted kidnapping and aggravated stalking, was found in possession of a knife and a ticket to the concert, police said. They added, however, that Hunt had neither made it inside the venue nor made contact with the singer. ARRESTED: Michael Hunt, for aggravated stalking & attempted kidnapping w/a weapon.

The next day, he wrote that he wanted to “see my queen on Friday,” the date of Del Rey’s Orlando concert. “[F]rom that day forward our decisions will be as one,” Hunt wrote. He also suggested in other posts that he was “leaving town” for good.
