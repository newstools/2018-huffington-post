  A man in Australia was taken for a wild ride after a shark snagged his line while he was fishing from a kayak off the coast of Balnarring in Victoria this weekend. After the 34-year-old man, identified by an Australian news outlet as Brett Palmer, hooked the shark, a struggle ensued. In an attempt to break free from the line, the powerful shark pulled Palmer into the water. Fortunately, he didn't become bait. His friends, who were fishing in a boat nearby, came to the rescue and pulled him out of the water, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Palmer later docked his boat on the shore and continued fishing with his friends on their vessel. When he returned for his kayak hours later, it was gone. The kayak had floated out to sea and a massive search-and-rescue effort was launched after people reported seeing it ― filled with fishing gear but without an occupant ― half a mile from shore at Cliff's Beach in Western Port Bay.
