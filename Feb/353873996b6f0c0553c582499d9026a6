An art student responded to a teacher’s suggestion that she should “dial down the feminism” in her work in the best possible way. In response to the male educator’s “tip,” 23-year-old London-based Alex Ruth Bertulis-Fernandes created this piece: Bertulis-Fernandes shared the image to Twitter on Wednesday night, and it immediately set the social media platform abuzz. It’s unclear exactly what format her artwork took, or whether it’s solely a digital image. Bertulis-Fernandes did not respond immediately to HuffPost’s request for comment. But in a subsequent tweet, she revealed that she’d been “overwhelmed” by the positive reaction and is now considering selling prints and T-shirts of the image.
