Thousands congregated in Johannesburg's original Chinatown in the city centre on Saturday evening to celebrate the dawn of a new year â€” the Year of the Dog â€” for the largest Chinese community in Africa. Photographer Gulshan Khan perfectly captured the spectacle and ceremony of the event, with hauntingly beautiful images of the carnival, performances, firework display, and all the diverse people who came to town.
