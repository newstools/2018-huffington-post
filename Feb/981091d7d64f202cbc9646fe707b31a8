My car radio’s volume HAS to be set on an even number or multiple of five. There is no alternative. #MyWeirdSuperstition I’m too afraid to say I don’t believe in ghosts because I’m scared they’ll hear and haunt me as a target #MyWeirdSuperstition I can’t eat chicken and eggs at the same time.. like how come I’d eat the mother in front of her children 😂#MyWeirdSuperstition Whenever I’m in the car, I have to finish listening to whatever song I’m listening to before I get out. If I don’t, it will get stuck in my head for the rest of the day. I call it “song karma”  #MyWeirdSuperstition I used to work at Target, and the customer’s total rang up to be $6.66... she said “Oh no, I ain’t having that.” and threw a pack of gum on her order to change the total. 😂 #MyWeirdSuperstition My grandma once found a fry in her onion rings and one hour later found 1$ on the street. Since then every time she orders them we put a fry in it and hide 1$ somewhere for her to find. She now has 136$. We might just be stupid lol #brokeforlife#MyWeirdSuperstition I have a pair of underwear and matching socks that contain little Einstein heads on them. I only wear them when taking science exams in order to channel the knowledge they hold. I’m now doing a PhD at Harvard, so obviously it works. It’s science, folks. #MyWeirdSuperstition
