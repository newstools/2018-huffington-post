Polygamist and businessman Musa Mseleku promised that the second season of his reality show, "Uthando Nes'thembu", would lift the lid on more details of the life he and his four wives together with kids lead on a daily basis. He did not lie. Set in Umtentweni in rural KwaZulu-Natal, the show follows Mseleku and his four wives — Ma Cele, Ma Yeni, Ma Khumalo, and Ma Ngwabe — as they navigate their polygamous relationship and family dynamic while staying true to tradition in a modern world and the sisterhood of the wives. The season kicked off with Mseleku and his second wife, MaYeni, taking their baby for a post-surgery check-up. It also shed more light on the fertility issues he's faced with his third wife, Makhumalo who — owing to two ectopic pregnancies — lost her fallopian tubes, affecting her ability to naturally conceive.

True to form, the latest episode was all about family. Viewers watched what happens when the wives don't make it home past their curfew. Makhumalo almost did not make it home thanks to car problems. But instead of rushing to his wife's rescue, Mseleku was not impressed that she was late. This also meant that since it was not her turn to spend the night with him, her time would run out.   After not having cooked in 10 years, Mseleku brought his wives and children together for a surprise dinner. And that's when some side-eyed their partners.
