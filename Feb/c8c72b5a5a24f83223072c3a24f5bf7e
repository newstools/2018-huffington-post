All eyes were on the ANC press briefing at Luthuli House on Tuesday afternoon, in which it announced the party's decision, at last, to recall President Jacob Zuma.  ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule explained what happened in the intense 13-hour special NEC meeting on Monday that lasted until the early hours of Tuesday.  The wait is finally over, but South Africans are not convinced – many believe that the briefing was not as clear as it should have been. Magashule could not answer simple questions – which is cause of concern.  Here's what tweeps had to say:     A sense of relief is definitely evident from some.  According to reports by Business Day, the rand weakened after the ANC admitted it had not given Zuma a deadline to resign, losing 0.2 percent to a session low of R11.95/$ at 2.18pm, from R11.88/$ before Magashule's press briefing.
