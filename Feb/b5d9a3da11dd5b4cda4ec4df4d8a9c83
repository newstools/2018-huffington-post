The long-awaited result of a groundbreaking "legacy partnership" between celebrated Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu and arts powerhouse the Market Theatre Foundation has finally been unveiled — and it's spectacular. The new murals, which are full of the colour, graphic linearity and punch associated with the 82-year-old artist, are located across three key locations around downtown Johannesburg — the Market Theatre foyer in Newtown, the brand-new Esther Mahlangu Boardroom at the Windybrow Theatre in Hillbrow, and the contemporary Market Square complex.  "This is the proudest moment in our 42 years, when the internationally acclaimed artist Esther Mahlangu and the iconic Market Theatre Foundation come together in a meeting of artistic expression," says chairman of the Market Theatre Foundation Kwanele Gumbi.
