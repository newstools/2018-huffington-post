An art student responded to a teacher’s suggestion that she should “dial down the feminism” in her work in the best possible way. In response to the male educator’s “tip,” 23-year-old London-based Alex Ruth Bertulis-Fernandes created this piece: Last week one of my art teachers suggested I 'dial down the feminism.' Today I showed him my newest piece: pic.twitter.com/VrnB4oJ8Cz Bertulis-Fernandes shared the image to Twitter on Wednesday night, and it immediately set the social media platform abuzz. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. Does it go to 11, because 100% down for that! I’m a female art teacher and am angry that a male art teacher said this to you.  I shall be showing this to my daughter, also a raging feminist, who is just about to go to art school and a lot of her work is about this too. Keep on challenging and read “The Power”. Omg I LOVE THIS. LOVE it. Keep that dial turned right up It’s unclear exactly what format her artwork took, or whether it’s solely a digital image. Bertulis-Fernandes did not respond immediately to HuffPost’s request for comment. But in a subsequent tweet, she revealed that she’d been “overwhelmed” by the positive reaction and is now considering selling prints and T-shirts of the image. Thanks for all the love shown to this piece, it really means the world. I'm a bit overwhelmed so it may take me some time to respond to everyone! I'm considering selling prints/t-shirts - just trying to figure out the best way to do this. Once I do I will share the details here.
