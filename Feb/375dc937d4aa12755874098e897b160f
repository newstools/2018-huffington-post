Finally, the Jacob Zuma era ends. The transition has been bumpy, filled with shade and anxiety. But South Africans are tired. We've been exhausted by a constant parade of "fruitful and constructive" discussions, "postponements", and denialism – such as president who kept asking: "What did I do wrong?" None of us will have much stomach for these phrases post Msholozi – in fact, South Africans on social media started calling out their constant use by ANC spokespeople a while ago.  Fruitful How many times did we hear that discussions between the ANC top six and Zuma were "fruitful"? The adjective was used recklessly by the ANC, and South Africans caught on.   Postponements Why, why, why was the governing party announcing events without any certainty? "Postponements" became another word frustrating South Africans — who just wanted to know what the next step was for Zuma. Still, it did give us a great new nickname for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa — "Ramapostponer".   What did I do wrong? The question constantly asked by Zuma. Wow, comrade former president — do you have a severe case of amnesia?
