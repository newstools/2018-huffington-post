[LATEST] News24 is reporting that the ANC's NEC has resolved to put an ultimatum to President Jacob Zuma: resign or be fired. He will have "a day or two" to make a decision. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has been dispatched to convey the message. The ANC's leadership has been in constant consultation with Zuma since last Sunday. Ramaphosa on Sunday said the NEC will bring "finality" and "closure" to the matter. Tsjoe! President Zuma really killed the green shoots of the Cyril Spring. It's almost midnight and it feels like Cyril Ramaphosa won't deliver on his promise of finality on Monday (today).  A short history of transition talks:
* Sunday: ANC top 6 asks ZUMA to resign. He says no.
* Monday: NWC says ZUMA must go.
* Tuesday: RAMAPHOSA asks ZUMA to resign. He says okay, but only if.
* W/T/F/S/S: ZUMA ignores ANC.
* Monday: ANC NEC asks ZUMA to resign. @TeamNews24  Cyril Ramaphosa has just left the official presidential residence in Pretoria where it is believed that he met met with President Jacob Zuma following an NEC meeting (@AlexMitchley) pic.twitter.com/0JnDGoNlEn  [EARLIER] Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is at President Jacob Zuma's official residence in Pretoria, Mahlamba'Ndlopfu, claims EFF leader Julius Malema.

There is no indication of the nature of the debate inside. News24 has reported the Collen Maine, leader of the ANC Youth League and an ardent supporter of Zuma, has left. The NEC deliberated for two days and into the night during the recall of former president Thabo Mbeki in September 2008. After the NEC took the decision a delegation of the party's leadership visited Mbeki in Pretoria in the early hours of the morning. The decision was announced to the media later that day. The NEC meeting started at 14:00. The presidency earlier denied reports that an agreement had been reached about Zuma's future. [EARLIER] According to an SABC report on Monday afternoon, Zuma had agreed to step down, adding that the only sticking point was who would communicate the decision: government or the ANC. BBC news correspondent Milton Nkosi also reported that the ANC had recalled Zuma. In a subsequent tweet, however, he said as a matter of 'clarification' that the ANC national executive committee (NEC) meeting was still ongoing. Although calls for Zuma to step down had been made, he said, there was no official announcement made by the ANC.
