Trevor responds to those outraged by the blackness of "Black Panther." #BetweenTheScenespic.twitter.com/fsYNnF292y Trevor Noah says the folks who are freaking out about the blackness of the new Marvel movie "Black Panther" need to chill. In a between-the-scenes moment from "The Daily Show" posted online Thursday, the host lamented how "some people got too hyped up the wrong way about" the movie, which has a largely black cast and has been conquering the box office. "They're like, 'So is it a black film?' It's like no, it's a film," said Noah. "It's the same way 'Wonder Woman' was a dope movie, and if you are a woman it was extra special," he added.
