He's an interesting subject to draw, and I will keep visually engaging images I find of him in newspapers and magazines. I feel that making these drawings are a way to keep a record of his disastrous and destructive reign," Botes says. "Like most South Africans, I've been following the news of the past few days closely, because the probability of him stepping down seems more real than ever before. "Yesterday morning [Tuesday] I decided to make a drawing of Zuma looking at his watch and added the text to the image â€“ I think the joke is rather obvious. I shared it on my Instagram account this morning because, after the latest news, the image seemed really relevant and somewhat funny right now."
