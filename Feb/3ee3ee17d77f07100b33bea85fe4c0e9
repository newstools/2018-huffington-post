Travel planning and booking website TripAdvisor recently released its 2018 list of the best hotels in the world â€” based on customer opinion. The reviews include first-hand experiences from travellers from all over the globe. The establishments are located in some of the most desirable destinations, from France to Tanzania. Although only two hotels from the African continent feature on the list, owner of southern Africa destination management company Specialised Tours and Events, Margi Biggs, believes this is not for a lack of world-class hotels in this country or continent. "The whole thing of competitions for top establishments is normally based on who the travellers are, where they travel to and how frequently they do this," she said. They are normally high-spend travellers from first-world countries, and they travel for both leisure and business, Biggs explained. "So it's got nothing to do with quality, but the number of hotel visitors." While we hope more African hotels feature on the list in future, here are some of the most gorgeous establishments on this year's list â€” in pictures:  A post shared by Janni DelÃ©r (@jannid) on Jan 18, 2017 at 2:22am PST   A post shared by Janni DelÃ©r (@jannid) on Jan 20, 2017 at 2:59am PST   A post shared by Abbie Owen ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (@abbieowenxo) on Jan 31, 2018 at 1:41am PST   A post shared by Jo Marsh (@joseyjo58) on Jan 12, 2018 at 4:18am PST   A post shared by AmyC (@amycullinan30) on Dec 28, 2017 at 12:44am PST  A post shared by The Oberoi, Mauritius (@theoberoimauritius) on Dec 29, 2017 at 12:47am PST   A post shared by The Oberoi, Mauritius (@theoberoimauritius) on Feb 1, 2018 at 8:06pm PST   A post shared by The Oberoi, Mauritius (@theoberoimauritius) on Jan 22, 2018 at 7:00am PST   A post shared by The Oberoi, Mauritius (@theoberoimauritius) on Jan 9, 2018 at 6:38pm PST   A post shared by The Oberoi, Mauritius (@theoberoimauritius) on Jan 31, 2018 at 1:02am PST   A post shared by Sharmeen Dossani (@sbdossani) on Dec 21, 2016 at 4:00am PST   A post shared by Matt Hinkel (@mhinkel55) on Dec 16, 2016 at 4:17pm PST   A post shared by Kelli Hodge (@kellikhodge) on Nov 24, 2016 at 6:39am PST   A post shared by Renee (@lilmizzpetty) on Sep 10, 2016 at 8:13am PDT   A post shared by Sweet Pea Events (@sweetpeateam) on Mar 9, 2016 at 9:00am PST  A post shared by TripAdvisor (@tripadvisor) on Jan 23, 2018 at 11:15am PST   A post shared by Galaxy Tours and Travels (@galaxytourstravels) on Jan 31, 2018 at 5:59am PST   A post shared by Mawe Moments (@mawemoments) on Jan 26, 2018 at 7:53am PST   A post shared by Heather Jacobs (@heatherjacobs71) on Jan 12, 2018 at 8:28pm PST   A post shared by Fabuluxe Lifestyle (@funemployees) on Jan 4, 2018 at 10:10am PST
