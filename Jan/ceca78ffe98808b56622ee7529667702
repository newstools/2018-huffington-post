I made peace with a battle that I have lost, I have accepted defeat. "My greatest fear and my greatest loss... letting go of the man I gave my heart to @edwardbillion it has taken so much from me in convincing my self that I am okay? Today I chose to face my fears and accept my truth. Today I let go of my greatest pain, love is pain. "For a while now I have been so insecure, so bitter and lonely, as the wise would say everything has its season. The hell what does that even mean? 😔My Summer has gone. My first of ever experience of being in love and being fearless but the very same love has made so small and so sore inside. I have lost me. "Today I let go of my future plans, the man I saw as the father of my kids and my future husband. My best friend. 😭 I am afraid, I am so afraid but I am going to learn how to love me genuinely first before I try and love again. Lord give me strength🙏."
