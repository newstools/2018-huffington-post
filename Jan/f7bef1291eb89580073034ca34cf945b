Clashes between EFF and ANC protesters and the police erupted at Vereeniging's Hoërskool Overvaal on Wednesday, as tensions outside the school reached boiling point. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters, and some were caught in the crossfire.   Police are firing rubber bullets. #HoërskoolOvervaal  There were further scenes of violence – including stun grenades and the burning of tires – as the protest reached its crescendo.

Lesufi will be addressing the media at Riverside High, the school which accepted a portion of the 55 students who were not accepted at #HoërskoolOvervaal    As a result, the EFF and ANC resorted to burning tires, intensifying the situation. #HoërskoolOvervaalpic.twitter.com/Mmm9RHh1qJ  Police have since kept the situation stable, and protestors have been dispersed – while paramedics attended to the injured.   One of the the stun grenades fired at protesters. #HoërskoolOvervaalpic.twitter.com/ep0VRtBirA  But what is frightening, is that all of this happens while Hoërskool Overvaal continues with classes, trying to maintain business as usual inside, while chaos erupted outside.
