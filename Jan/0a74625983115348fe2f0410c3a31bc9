Come February 8, Cosmopolitan magazine will crown the winner of its Sexiest SA Men 2018 campaign. Every year, readers get to vote for their sexiest man from a list of 12 finalists. This year's competition also shines the spotlight on #AdoptDontShop, encouraging people to adopt pets instead of buying -- which explains why the finalists are all posing with dogs. All the dogs are rescues from the SPCA, and every single one of them needs a home. To adopt a pet, visit your nearest SPCA. Here are the finalists: Blake "The Champ" Williams. Aged 26. Hip-hop dancer and motivational speaker.
