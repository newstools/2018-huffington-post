Today is a humbling day says SA CEO Calvo Mawela pic.twitter.com/49Vp2O8PQ5 #Multichoice board investigated contract with @ANN7 and the board had independent auditors and a law firm assisting. No corruption found says Calvo Mawela Finding: mistakes made my Multichoice managers erred in contract with @ANN7 and in how they lobbied.
Board found Poor communications and contract management but contract eith Gupta TV was commercially sound, says Calvo Mawela Finding. The advance payment to @ANN7 was neither illegal or unusual. It happens in industry says Mawela.
(Guptas ran empire on prepayments) #Multichoice Board found no connection between. attrmpt to influence regulation and policy and the @ANN7 contract.#Multichoice is overhauling its lobbying policy and procedure Imtiaz Patel, Multichoice CEO, knew Guptas but he did not allow this to influence the contract with Gipta TV.#Multichoice #Multichoice is taking bids to host a black-owned channel to replace @ANN7tv when contract ends in June #Multichoice apologises to ANC MP Yunus Carrim. #Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk says allegations have caused him a great deal of concern and he is humbled by public outrage. #Multichoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela has used word humbled many times and apologised for failings seceral times.
(Big change in company's approach to story of how @ANN7tv came to be hosted on its platform) #Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk says @ANN7tv required higher level of diligence.
Imtiaz Patel, who negotiated the cobtract, acted in #Multichoice's best interests. #Multichoice says the R25-mn mystery payment was a standard advance payment.#Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk says nobody has bern fired because of the incident. #Multichoice has met with @MzwaneleManyi to tell him it will no longer host @ANN7tv - he is weighing his options
(Multichoice hosting fees are biggest slice of @ANN7tv revenues) So yes, #Multichoice made it a condition precedent that the SABC must oppose terrestrial encryption in order to receive a big bag of money. After which "the SABC decided of its own accord that it accepts the provision".
But Mawela is baffled that this is an issue. Multichoice says there was no corruption, no one has been disciplined but a whole news channel is not being renewed. It just doesn't add up. #Multichoice Mawela: We are not a part of #StateCapture. This is a commercial relationship. We pay @ANN7tv for a service everyone can see Multichoice hearing is... interesting. Lots of uncomfortable shifting and spluttering. .@MultiChoice board will not share the report by lawyers and auditors with media. Comfortable that all findings were shared in press statement. @News24  So @MultiChoice is saying there is a report that found it is not guilty of corruption but the report is secret? ðŸ¤” https://t.co/ykmYVgnNHY
