Winter may come again ... in April 2019? “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams — a.k.a. Arya Stark in HBO’s epic fantasy drama ― appears to have inadvertently revealed when the show will return to television screens for its eighth and final season. “We wrap in December and we air our first episode in April (2019),” she said in an interview that British newspaper Metro shared online Wednesday. HBO had already confirmed the show would conclude in 2019, but had not offered up details of exactly when.  “We have announced 2019,” a spokesperson told HuffPost via email on Saturday morning. “Nothing more specific than that at this time.” Williams could of course be wrong. April 2019 could be the date that producers are aiming for, and it may obviously be pushed back ― given that filming is not scheduled to stop for another 11 months.
