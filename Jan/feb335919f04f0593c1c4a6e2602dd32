South Africa's shining stars of Ladysmith Black Mambazo have won the Best World Music Album award at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards on Sunday. The world-famous ensemble took the award for "Shaka Zulu Revisited: 30th Anniversary Collection", the fifth time the group has won at the Grammys. The group was also nominated Sunday for Children's Album. Meanwhile, music's biggest night started before most people were even watching, as many winners were announced hours before the ceremony started Sunday night. Rap and hip-hop dominated the nominations with the awards show being hailed as one of the most diverse in Grammy history. Jay-Z led the pack with an impressive eight nods for his album "4:44." Kendrick Lamar earned seven nominations, and "That's What You Like" singer Bruno Mars was up for six awards. All three were nominated for Album of the Year, as were Childish Gambino and Lorde ― making it the first time since 1999 that a white man wasn't nominated in the category. The ceremony, which is being held in New York City for the first time since 2003, is as much about performances as it is about handing out statues. Lady Gaga, Kesha, Mars, Sam Smith, Lamar and SZA are set to take the stage Sunday night. James Corden is returning to host the awards show for the second year in a row. Check out the full list of 2018 Grammy winners: Record of the Year: "Redbone" ― Childish Gambino "Despacito" ― Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber "The Story Of O.J." ― JAY-Z "HUMBLE." ― Kendrick Lamar "24K Magic" ― Bruno Mars - (WINNER) Song of the Year: "Despacito"― Ramón Ayala, Justin Bieber, Jason "Poo Bear" Boyd, Erika Ender, Luis Fonsi & Marty James Garton, songwriters (Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber) "4:44" ― Shawn Carter & Dion Wilson, songwriters (JAY-Z) "Issues" ― Benny Blanco, Mikkel Storleer Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen "1-800-273-8255" ― Alessia Caracciolo, Arjun Ivatury, Khalid Robinson, Sir Robert Bryson Hall II "That's What I Like" ― Christopher Brody Brown, James Fauntleroy, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Ray Charles McCullough II, Jeremy Reeves, Ray Romulus & Jonathan Yip, songwriters (Bruno Mars) - (WINNER) Best New Artist:
