The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has requested a meeting with H&M to get an understanding about how it's racist advert involving a child could have been approved by the company's marketing and management team. The foundation wrote a letter H&M's local and global headquarters saying: ""It is of serious concern that your company published the advert without considering the historical context of how the word and image of a 'monkey' has been used to racially demean black people for generations."   This is not the first time that H&M has landed in hot water. In 2015, a social media user blasted the company for not featuring black models following the opening of their stores in South Africa.
