A £960,000 (R16 million) bottle of vodka – claimed to be the most expensive in the world – has been stolen from a Copenhagen bar. The Russo-Baltique bottle was on loan to a Danish collector when it was seized from the Café 33 bar in the Vesterbro district. Bar owner Brian Ingerberg told TV2 Lorry: "I had loaned [the bottle] from Russia from something called the Dartz Factory, which makes the world's most expensive cars and vodka. It has been part of my collection for six months, but not anymore. "I am obviously very upset. It was the icing on the cake in my collection. Of the 1,200 bottles I have, this was a very special bottle." Ingerberg has released CCTV images of the thieves, speculating that the masked individuals pictured may have somehow obtained a key. The theft has been reported to the police. Why is it so expensive?
