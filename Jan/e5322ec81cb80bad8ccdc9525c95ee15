Ever been in a museum and wondered what you would look like painted in oils and put up on a giant canvas? Well now is your chance to find out. Because we didnâ€™t have enough pointless procrastination tools at our disposal already, Google has updated their Arts and Culture app to allow people to find their artistic doppelgÃ¤nger. Just by uploading a selfie, the app uses artificial intelligence to scan your features and try to find a match in its database of thousands of portraits. The app has been around since 2016, but the new experimental idea (which has so far only been launched in the USA) has seen the app be propelled to number one position in the American Apple app store within 24 hours. So we imagine theyâ€™ll be keen to rollout the feature elsewhere around the world. Until that point, we can sit back and enjoy the (seriously) unflattering comparisons that some people are being served up by Google. The Google Arts and Culture app straight up just bullied me pic.twitter.com/fXd5HXbjow Other people got a little carried away with their own versions of the app. But most people thought their results were actually a pretty fair representation. This google arts and culture app is pretty amazing. Feel real strong about my 40% ðŸ˜³ pic.twitter.com/2iyexRkUG5 GET THE GOOGLE ARTS AND CULTURE APP IT HAS A PART WHERE YOU CAN TAKE A SELFIE AND IT TELLS YOU WHAT PAINTING YOU LOOK LIKE I LOOK LIKE THIS POP ART HOUSEWIFE APPARENTLY pic.twitter.com/IMcec2u2bZ I'm a study for death, and proud of it! pic.twitter.com/BLvvrjNe4R I downloaded the Google Arts and Culture app to use the face comparison tool. My students have been telling me for years King Henry VIII was my doppelgÃ¤nger and they seem to have been right. Guess my Halloween costume for next year is set. pic.twitter.com/nfPcHvCn0y This Google Arts and Culture app is scarily accurate. pic.twitter.com/9TEngKUdkd Now weâ€™ve just got to wait for it to arrive in the UK.
