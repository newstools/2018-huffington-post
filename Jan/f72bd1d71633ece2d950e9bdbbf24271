Since confirming her pregnancy, Khloe Kardashian has been open about her cravings, her workouts and dealing with her changing body. On Thursday, the 33-year-old got real with her followers and tweeted about seeing a little more cellulite on her legs now that she’s almost seven months pregnant. Kardashian also tweeted about not having stretch marks yet, which she joked was one of “the perks of being chubby previously.” A blogger known as Carmen ― who runs the site “A Side of Crunchy” ― took issue with the reality star’s remark. She tweeted that more celebrities should “embrace pregnancy” and her cellulite. Khloe, who’s more than experienced in dealing with Twitter hate, sweetly shot down claims that she isn’t enjoying ― or embracing ― being pregnant. This isn’t the first time the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has fought back against people criticizing her for something during her pregnancy. Previously, some on social media weren’t happy when Kardashian shared her pregnancy workouts on Snapchat and said it would hurt the baby. “No it cannot! My doctor has instructed me to do so,” Khoe tweeted back in response. “Why does everyone on social media think they are a physician?? Why would I do anything to do that? If you don’t know mind your business.” Kardashian and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, confirmed in December that they were expecting their first child after months of speculation. “My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby!” the reality star wrote in an emotional Instagram. “I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can’t believe that our love created life!” A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Dec 20, 2017 at 2:41pm PST
