What’s the best thing to do after chowing down on some pizza? Hitting up a museum, dude! Michelangelo, the animated character you may recognize as one of the famed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, visited New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art on Thursday. Why? To enjoy the work of his Renaissance name-fellow, Michelangelo Buonarroti, of course! This morning we welcomed Michelangelo, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (@TMNT) at The Met.  Our celebrity guest came to see the work of an artist who happens to share his name. https://t.co/jUPJhto7Xr#MetMichelangelopic.twitter.com/YS7T5xZv9a The Met’s exhibition dedicated to the sculptor and “Sistine Chapel” painter is entitled “Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman & Designer.” It includes 133 of Michelangelo’s drawings, three of his marble sculptures, his earliest painting, his wood architectural model for a chapel vault, and a “substantial body of complementary works by other artists for comparison and context.” The exhibit has been open since mid-November, even though one of everybody’s favorite reptiles is only visiting now. It remains on display through Feb. 12. Michelangelo the sewer-dweller looks like he had a grand time taking in some sweet art: i love this so much 😭 pic.twitter.com/yqCzOPHt6z Stay tubular AND cultural, Michelangelo! Share this slide:
