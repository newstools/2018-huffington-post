America Ferrera has an eventful year planned. The “Ugly Betty” and “Superstore” actress revealed on New Year’s Eve that she is pregnant with her first child. Ferrera posted a photo to Instagram on Sunday that showed her and husband Ryan Piers Williams wearing goofy party glasses and holding a baby’s outfit. “We’re welcoming one more face to kiss in 2018!” read the caption.  The anticipated arrival would mean that Ferrera and her “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-stars would all be mothers, Entertainment Tonight reported, noting that Blake Lively, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn already have children.  Ferrera, 33, and Williams, 36, were married in 2011.
