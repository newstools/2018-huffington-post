The independent team of researchers at Viceroy have taken aim at Capitec Bank, calling the financial institution a "wolf in sheep's clothing" and accusing it of "reckless lending practices". Viceroy Research made headlines last year when it uncovered accounting irregularities at global furniture giant Steinhoff. Now, in a 33-page report on Tuesday, Viceroy called on the South African Reserve Bank and finance minister Malusi Gigaba to immediately place Capitec into curatorship. Jean Pierre Verster, independent director and chairman of Capitec's audit committee, is and/or was indirectly short Capitec through Steinhoff. We believe this is an oversight, and understand Jean Pierre is an excellent analyst on the short side. $CPI#JSE 1/2  Viceroy – claiming to have information from the bank's financial records corroborated by interviews with ex-employees and former customers – believes it's "only a matter of time before Capitec's financials and business unravel, with macro headwinds creating an exponential risk of default and bankruptcy". Here are five things you need to know about the investigation: Despite the rhetoric of management and the sell-side, we see no operational difference between Capitec and its ill-fated predecessors, including African Bank Investments. $CPI#JSE 2/2  South Africa's microfinancing sector has been the graveyard of numerous Capitec competitors who chased the same meteoric growth Capitec now displays, largely due to low acceptance and mass delinquencies. $CPI#JSE 1/2  News24 reported that Capitec's shares were trading down 7.8 percent on Tuesday at 10.30am, after earlier trading down by 10 percent. The bank tweeted that it has "taken note of the Viceroy report on Capitec Bank. We are currently in the process of investigating the report in detail and will respond appropriately".
