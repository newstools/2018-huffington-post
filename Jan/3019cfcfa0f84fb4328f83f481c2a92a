Basic education minister Angie Motshekga has condemned ongoing violence outside the Hoërskool Overvaal secondary school in Vereeniging. The violence flared up on Wednesday morning, when Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters protested outside the school, burning tyres and singing anti-apartheid struggle songs. Several people wearing red T-shirts had gathered outside the school to demonstrate against its language and admissions policy. This came after the High Court in Pretoria ruled on Monday to set aside the decision by the Gauteng department of education to admit 55 learners to be taught in English at the Afrikaans-medium school.
