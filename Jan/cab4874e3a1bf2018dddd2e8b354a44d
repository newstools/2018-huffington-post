Ellen DeGeneres' father Elliot died this week at the age of 92, the television show host announced on Thursday. But just as she was coming to terms with her loss, DeGeneres spotted a beautiful sight in the sky. DeGeneres told her studio audience that her dad, a former insurance salesman,  had a good, long life and had always managed to live "exactly how he wanted." Her family had been preparing for some time for his death. Before he passed away, DeGeneres said that she spoke with her father and was able to say goodbye to him. After the chat, she said she was leaving the Warner Brother Studio's building. Then, she looked back and saw a rainbow shining above her studio. "This looks photoshopped," she said, as she showed her audience a photo of the rainbow. "This is what I saw after I talked to my dad and he died 10 minutes later after that. Pretty amazing." "I got a rainbow before he died," she said. DeGeneres told her audience that her dad was a "very funny" man who gave her and her brother Vance DeGeneres their sense of humor. He was also apparently a very religious person ― he never went to the doctor or took medicine because of his beliefs as a Christian Scientist. DeGeneres, who is originally from Louisiana, remembered that growing up, her dad only took her on one family vacation. The family ended up touring the Warner Bros. studio lot in California ― the same place where DeGeneres now tapes her show. The television host said that her dad was very proud of all she'd accomplished and loved her show. "He was a kind man, very accepting man. There was not one bone of judgment in his body," she said.
