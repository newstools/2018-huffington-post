A parent was reportedly assaulted by protesters outside Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging on Wednesday morning, allegedly by EFF members. Several people wearing red T-shirts had gathered outside the school to demonstrate against its language and admissions policy. #HoërskoolOvervaal Some tension as tempers rise outside court with @EFFSouthAfrica members and some in @MYANC shirts rushed at the school gate shouting, "Racists." @danmoyanepic.twitter.com/2SXoU2ri2z  EWN reported earlier that a "peaceful protest" was expected outside the school following the North Gauteng High Court's ruling on Monday to set aside the decision by the Gauteng department of education to admit 55 learners to be taught in English at the Afrikaans-medium school.  Judge William Prinsloo delivered a scathing judgment in favour of the Afrikaans-medium school. He upheld an urgent application by the school governing body (SGB) to overturn the decision by the Gauteng department of education to force the school to admit 55 learners. The department deemed the application by the Vereeniging school's SGB a way to exclude pupils who do not speak Afrikaans, but the school maintains there is not enough space to accommodate the additional learners.
