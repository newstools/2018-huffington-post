According to Reuters, around a dozen people had been carried from the building on stretchers. Indonesian news outlet MetroTV reported that 15 ambulances were dispatched to the scene. “The second floor of the building has collapsed,” said Vindy, a personal assistant to the exchange’s President Director Tito Sulistio, per Reuters.
