A large group of protesters dressed in EFF regalia have stormed the H&M stores in Sandton, Menlyn Park and East Rand on Saturday, trashing the stores in an apparent protest of an online ad that has been labelled racist. REZA Crime Network have reported shots fired at the East Rand H&M.     The REZA Crime Network also urged shoppers to avoid the H&M in Santon City, which was also trashed.    'Racist' advert at heart of protest EFF's Floyd Shivambu tweeted: "That @hm nonsense of a clothing store is now facing consequences for its racism. All rational people should agree that the store should not be allowed to continue operating in South Africa. Well done to Fighters who physically confronted racism." The international chain store earlier this week apologised after an outcry on Twitter over an advert depicting a black child wearing green hoodie with the inscription "coolest monkey in the jungle".   The company apologised on its Twitter account and said it would investigate the online shopping ad, which sparked outrage among observers on social media. "We've not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering," the group said. News24
