Johannesburg theatre-lovers rejoiced this week when they learnt that they'd get to experience a ballet accompanied by a live orchestra â€“ rather than watching the dancers perform to recorded music, which local audiences have become accustomed to over the years. Joburg Ballet announced this week that it would be restoring its partnership with the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra for its upcoming season of "Carmen" - a tragic tale of love and heartbreak set to the magical music of Spanish composer Georges Bizet's opera. Have you booked your tickets for 'Carmen' yet? The sizzling production is our first season of 2018. Make sure you don't miss it! Here are Soloists, @monikecs and Revil Yon, as Carmen and Don Jose in a photo shoot by @laugesorensen. . . . . . . #joburgballet #ballet #ballerina #dancer #dancers #dancersamongus #dancersofig #joburgballet #bitesizeballet #worldwideballet #worldwidedance #joburg #southafrica #jbcarmen A post shared by  Joburg Ballet (@joburgballet) on Jan 21, 2018 at 10:58pm PST  The news comes after major reshuffles at both the ballet company and the orchestra, which have both faced serious criticism for the lack of live accompaniment to the world-class ballet company. Joburg Ballet's newly appointed CEO, Esther Nasser, admitted that the partnership was long overdue. "No matter how fine a ballet company is, dancing to a live orchestra brings a dynamic brilliance and dramatic force to performances. Joburg Ballet is thrilled to be working with the JPO in an association that brings two of Johannesburg's most applauded artistic companies together," Nasser said in a statement released this week. Yesterday our Principals had their first rehearsal for one of the incredible pas de deuxs in 'Carmen' and the Company had a sneak peak at the choreography by watching the video of the last performance a few years ago. It really is going to be an incredible season! Here is Soloist, @sanmariek, as Carmen. . . . . . . #joburgballet #ballet #ballerina #dancer #dancers #dancersamongus #dancersofig #joburgballet #bitesizeballet #worldwideballet #worldwidedance #joburg #southafrica #jbcarmen A post shared by  Joburg Ballet (@joburgballet) on Jan 23, 2018 at 11:08pm PST  Opening night is on Friday, April 6, when leads Claudia Monja and Leusson Muniz will steer the performance.
