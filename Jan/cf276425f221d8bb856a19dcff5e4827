Back to school, back to reality... Public schools throughout South Africa officially opened on Wednesday, and parents of both Grade 1 and matric pupils shared pictures of their nervous and excited children on social media.   Some pupils are attending school for the very first time, while others are in their final year of high school as the matric class of 2018 begin their final journey as schoolgoers.  Here are some of the best #BackToSchool tweets:    Grade 1☺️ First day ❤️ #BackToSchoolpic.twitter.com/7vmhEeJSsO
