Local celebrities were among the many South Africans dropping their children off for the first day of school this year – and quite a few stars shared the cutest pics on social media of their kids heading off to class; some for the very first time. Here are some of the snaps: LeAnne Dlamini: Hello Grade 3 !!!!! Can't believe my girl is getting so big. She was so excited to meet her new teacher, Miss Bunce. Blessings for the year ahead my Zani.
