Reese Witherspoon has urged fans to accept her for who she is after she appeared to have a third leg on the cover of the new Vanity Fair. The ‘Big Little Lies’ star’s extra limb was highlighted by eagle-eyed fans, who took to Twitter to point out that her legs are crossed at the side of her in the pic, but she also appears to have another leg at the back. im tryna figure out how many legs reese witherspoon’s got in here, it’s been bothering me for the last five minutes pic.twitter.com/u1uQ63sDdd Taking to Twitter, the actress wrote: “Well...I guess everybody knows now...I have 3 legs. I hope you can still accept me for who I am. ( and I will never apologize for snuggling @Oprah... if you get the opportunity, I highly recommend it;)” However, Vanity Fair have denied it’s a Photoshop fail, insisting it is just the lining of Reese’s dress.

I hope you can still accept me for who I am. 😃( and I will never apologize for snuggling @Oprah .. if you get the opportunity,  I highly recommend it;) https://t.co/6GyrfWxNSY And Oprah Winfrey is also getting in on the extra limb action. In another pic from the magazine’s A-list shoot, the chat show queen appears to have three hands.

As I know you accept my 3d hand.” Addressing the error, Vanity Fair tweeted: “While we would have loved the exclusive on @RWitherspoon’s three legs, unfortunately it’s just the lining of her dress. “As for @Oprah, how can we expect her to juggle it all with just two hands? (We are correcting this error​ online​.)” As for @Oprah, how can we expect her to juggle it all with just two hands? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯_/¯ (We are correcting this error​ online​.) https://t.co/QNd74YtSTz The issue features 12 stars and one journalist on the cover, focusing in part on the Time’s Up movement to end sexual harassment in Hollywood.
