A YouTube vlogger in Namibia, also known to U.S. President Donald Trump as "Nambia", has released a flawless satirical take on so-called "sh*thole" African countries, with a video that'll make any citizen proud to be from a "sh*thole country".  Since Trump made those comments, there have been countless responses from people on social media, especially those located in so-called "sh*thole countries", including the U.S. embassy in South Africa. The US deeply respects the people of #Africa & values partnerships w/ them. There has been no change in our dedication to partners & friends across the Continent. We remain committed to working together to realize the promise of a more prosperous 21st century Africa. @MaxduPreez  But perhaps the best response was that by the Namibian vlogger who calls his channel EES TV NAMIBIA, who posted a YouTube video showcasing the rich natural beauty of the country that makes it a tourist magnet â€“ a "sh*thole country" of the highest calibre. "Goodmorning Trump America, if ever you want to leave your so beautiful and perfect country and come to a ðŸ’© hole country in Africa, we would like to invite you to come to sh**hole Namibia (sic)," the post read.
