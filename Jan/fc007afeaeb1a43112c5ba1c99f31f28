Eric Trump set Twitter alight Wednesday with a flimsy defense of his father against accusations of racism. President Donald Trump’s second son told “Fox & Friends” his dad couldn’t possibly be racist because he only “sees one color, green.” “That’s all he cares about. He cares about the economy. Right, he does not see race,” Eric Trump said. “He’s the least racist person I have ever met in my entire life. It is total nonsense.” “My father sees one color: Green. That’s all he cares about. He cares about the economy” - @EricTrumppic.twitter.com/dbiEICQkb2 Eric Trump offered the defense during a discussion of last week’s White House meeting on immigration, when participants said his father described Haiti and some African nations as “shithole countries.” Trump denied using those words, but Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who was present, contradicted him and said the president repeatedly used the racist insult. Eric Trump said it was “very sad” that his father’s critics would continue to demonize the president, even if he cured cancer. Many people, however, called out the Trump scion’s defense, claiming it shows how the Trump administration was only looking out for itself. Here’s a sampling of reaction on Twitter: pic.twitter.com/MQQs3dOd1N Green: the color of money or the color of envy? Either way it’s still troubling. Apparently that fitness exam didn't test for colorblindness. I see green too 🤢 All he cares about HIS money. pic.twitter.com/5RwiuLm0Pc And with all of his bankruptcies and not paying his contractors, he doesn't even see green very well. The son finally admits the truth: The father only cares about money. pic.twitter.com/fopyf97mmE Green? So he’s basically the GRINCH??? @EricTrumpYou mean he turns green, when a non-white person enters the WH! pic.twitter.com/PiQ8cighk5 The Trump family are Sleestaks from “Land of the Lost”.
