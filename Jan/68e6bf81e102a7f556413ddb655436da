The stars brought their fashion A-game to the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night. The ceremony, hosted at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, honors the favorite performances in film and television over the past year. It is often the best prediction for who will take home an Academy Award in March. This year, the SAG Awards boasts a roster of all female presenters, including Emma Stone, Halle Berry and Olivia Munn, and it will also for the first time ever have a host, “The Good Place” actress Kristen Bell. Some stars dressed all in black and sported pins in support of the Time’s Up initiative, an action plan and legal defense fund that’s raised millions to support to victims of sexual harassment and assault. Earlier his month at the Golden Globes, actors and actresses almost universally blacked out the awards show. This time around, most opted for brighter shades, bringing some color to the red carpet before the ceremony officially kicked off. Check out the all of the looks below. Share this slide:
