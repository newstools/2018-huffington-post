President Donald Trump's "fake news" awards didn't get off to a great start on Wednesday when they crashed the GOP's servers. And it didn't get much better from there. Much of the reaction on social media centered on the president's own reputation for "fake news." The Washington Post earlier this month reported that Trump has made more than 2,000 false or misleading claims in his first 355 days in office. Others mockingly wished to win the awards themselves or cracked jokes. And still others called Trump the "#FakePresident." Here is some of that reaction: WE WERE ROBBED! https://t.co/JdKLUZ5aIp#FakeNewsAwardspic.twitter.com/HOd2ER7CaO @seanhannity was robbed! His work on the Seth Rich story was the most underrated fake news of the year. Tonight, @realDonaldTrump released his long-promised #FakeNewsAwards.

History may have forgotten it, but another notable world leader had a famous conflict with the press: Hitler. pic.twitter.com/vm76z6lGfE I'd love for BuzzFeed to win, but really it's an honor to just live under an administration that devalues the press pic.twitter.com/ylg0HGBAaN So,did @FoxNews sweep the #FakeNewsAwards ? In response to Trump's #FakeNewsAwards, CPJ on January 8 announced #PressOppressors awards #TheFakieshttps://t.co/BGL3oaBrSq Can't handle how embarassing this Fake News Awards list is. It's the definition of a snowflake nitpicking minor errors while 99% of Trump's statements are flat out lies.

I mean, holy sh*t, "Trump dumps box of fish food" is one of his top ten "fake news" topics.

So embarassing. The presidents's #FakeNewsAwards is just the latest in a long list of attacks against our First Amendment's freedom of the press.

No really, we have a list. https://t.co/4UY91noUTJ And the winner of #FakeNewsAwards is... 404 Error (guess Moscow server is down for maintenance) pic.twitter.com/nEq7rEZAnU Share this slide:
