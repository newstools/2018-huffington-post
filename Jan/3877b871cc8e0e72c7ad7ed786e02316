Some say it's been placed there to intimidate the Indian cricket team, others say it's the start of South Africa's very own military coup â€“ but it was actually a system failure that led to the new addition to the SuperSport Park cricket ground: a gigantic high-powered G6 cannon. Pictures surfaced on social media on Thursday of what appeared to be a large military-grade cannon that had crashed through the barrier at the stadium and rolled on to the cricket outfield.

A source told HuffPost that South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members were attempting to move their military display, which had been open to the public for the duration of the second Test, when the engine and brakes on the cannon failed, causing it to break through the barriers and on to the field. Luckily, there were no spectators in the stadium at the time, and there were no injuries.  It's not a coup!   Titans CEO Jacques Faul said not much damage was incurred. "This will not affect any fixtures scheduled at the stadium. The biggest damage was to the LED advertising screen. It happened around 9.30am [on Thursday] morning... We are thankful to the military for putting on the display. These things happen when moving equipment at a stadium," he said.  Did they bring in the military for when the Captain does his pitch report?   SANDF spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said the incident occurred while their personnel were moving their "static military display". "The details of what happened, I do not have as yet. It happened while they were demobilising the static display. Nobody was injured," he said.
