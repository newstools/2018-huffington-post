South Africans are divided over the Economic Freedom Fighters' violent protest at H&M, following alleged racism in an advertising campaign. As always in South Africa, people took to social media to argue vociferously about whether the EFF is using appropriate methods to address racism.  The furore over the H&M hoodie bearing the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle" and modelled in the offending ad by a black child escalated to new heights over the weekend.  The EFF stormed the H&M store in Sandton on Saturday and wrecked it, damaging stock and fixtures as they rampaged through the store. The mob vandalism prompted H&M to close all their stores, and caused massive uproar in the Twitter "discourse" on racism in South Africa.
