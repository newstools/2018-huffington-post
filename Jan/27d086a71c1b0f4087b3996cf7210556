Great news, Ikea shoppers! Thanks to a new print ad you can find out if you’re pregnant and discover a discount on a crib, Adweek reports. It sounds like a wonderfully pragmatic deal until you find out the catch — you actually have to pee on the ad to find out said discount. The ad, which will run in Swedish magazine Amelia, uses the same kind of technology as at-home pregnancy tests and when someone pregnant pees on it, a discounted price on the Sundvik crib model magically appears. It’s cool that the ad provides a free pregnancy test and all, but Adweek does not mention how one would actually go about getting the discount at an Ikea store, and Ikea has not yet responded to a HuffPost request to clear the matter up. But if one has to physically present a urine-soaked ad to a cashier, they better throw in some free hand sanitizer in the deal. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that peeing on the ad reveals the discount, but it isn’t clear how a customer goes about getting said discount at Ikea.  Share this slide:
