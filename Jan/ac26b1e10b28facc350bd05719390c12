Soccer legend Mark Fish took to Twitter to thank the late Hugh Masekela for his contribution to South Africa's music and political scene things quickly went from a 100 to zero, real quick. Following the news of Masekela's passing, Fish joined South Africans who paid tributes to Masekela, a world-renowned jazz musician. There was, however, a tiny problem -- he used a picture of the wrong legend, Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse instead of Masekela. Am I allowed to laugh? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙉 #MarkFishpic.twitter.com/PB9LT3Pn5P  Mabuse himself soon confirmed on the app that he was alive and well. #MarkFish I am very much alive - oops ask my family or manager @MartinMyers or @BillyMonama - I am alive and well pic.twitter.com/5MWU2Hyhup  Fish deleted the picture and apologised for the error but people would not let him get off that easily. We love you too Neil Tovey  In came the #MarkFishChallenge.
