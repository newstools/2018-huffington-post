The Democratic Alliance (DA) has presented a Gupta charge sheet to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to assist with its investigation on the controversial family. The DA welcomed the decision by the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) of the NPA to go after the Gupta family and serve a summons to preserve their assets worth in the region of R1.6-billion.   "This is not a result of Shaun Abrahams, who tried to stall, but as a result of pressure and hard work of the AFU team under advocate Knox Molelle. The DA has doggedly pursued those suspected of being involved in the project of state capture, with a number of us laying criminal charges against key individuals," said DA shadow minister of justice and constitutional development Glynnis Breytenbach in a press statement.
