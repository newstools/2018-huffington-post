Brazilian pop supergroup Dream Team do Passinho's latest music video is creating a stir in their home country, and the designs of local knitwear label Maxhosa are all over it. Designed by Nelson Mandela Bay-born designer Laduma Ngxokolo, the knitwear is inspired by his Xhosa heritage, embracing the legacy of the tribe's world-famous beadwork. 


                                                                


    
      Laduma has recently been a featured artist at New York City's Museum of Modern Art, and has been worn by celebrities such as Beyonc√©. According to the museum, Laduma was included in the Is Fashion Modern? exhibition -- which features 111 objects from around the world -- because of his design's "profound impact on the world over the last century".
