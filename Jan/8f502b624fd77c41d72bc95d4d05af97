The ANC Women's League (ANCWL) on Thursday said it hoped that the terms of reference in the Commission of Inquiry set by Jacob Zuma would include all state owned entities(SOE'S) and date back pre-1994. In a statement, ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said: "ANCWL supports the fight against corruption in government and [the] private sector without fear or favour and firmly believes that the commission of inquiry will expose all those involved in fraud and corruption."

"Section 35(3)(h) of the Bill of Rights guarantees for everyone the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be presumed innocent at that trial until proven guilty," Matuba said. "The ANCWL has been consistent in calling for [a] full-scale investigation [of] the allegations of state capture instead of a narrow politically motivated investigation."

On December 13 last year, the Pretoria High Court held that Zuma must personally pay the costs of his bid to block the 2016 release of then-public protector Thuli Madonsela's report on state capture. Zuma announced on Tuesday that he had appointed Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to head the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.
