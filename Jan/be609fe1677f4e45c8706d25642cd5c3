BBC reporter Alex Dunlop found himself bombarded by lemurs while trying to report on the annual animal count at Banham Zoo in Norfolk, England.   Dunlop attempted to give his report as the creatures jumped on and off his shoulders and clambered up his sweater.

At one point, he gamely said, “Well, this I think is one of the more enjoyable parts of the job.” Yup, those Madagascar natives really “like to move it, move it.”
