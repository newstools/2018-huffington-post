A flash of bright light, followed by a boom, filled the night skies over parts of Michigan on Tuesday, prompting speculation that a meteor had streaked by. Residents in Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and other cities in southeast Michigan reported hearing and seeing the "boom and flash in the sky" about 8:15 p.m. Some said they felt their homes shake. #Meteorite or #meteor over #Clarkston#Michigan tonight at 20:08:30 local time #science#astronomy@NASA@wxyzdetroit@Local4News@CNNpic.twitter.com/Zrq6NhcKPA "When Armageddon is near, you better get out of of here.

The National Weather Service in Detroit suggested the flash could've been caused by a meteor, though they said they couldn't confirm that to be the case. "After looking at various observational datasets, [the NWS has] confirmed that it was not lightning or thunder, but instead a possible meteor or some other astronomical activity," Rich Pollman, a meteorologist at NWS Detroit, told HuffPost.
