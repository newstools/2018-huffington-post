Pop superstar Rihanna took to the 60th Grammy Awards stage on Sunday night in a pink dress and silver heels. She had matching flower on her head. Everything looked "normal", and there were no signs of extraordinary things happening â€“ until the last few seconds of her "Wild Thoughts" performance alongside DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller. No one was ready for her interpretation of South African-inspired Gwara Gwara dance moves. Twitter went wild â€“ both during and long after her performance. Although many on Twitter were focused on speculation that Riri could be pregnant, most South Africans wanted to make one thing clear â€“ the dance moves. U.S. online magazine Vulture tweeted that the "Umbrella" hitmaker was doing the "stanky leg" â€“ to much South African disapproval.  The responses (or rather corrections) came streaming in.     DJ Bongz, who made the dance move popular, has also responded to the performance with... well, a video of himself dancing the Gwara Gwara. @badgalriri let's do thisðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥  If you're still confused â€“ the dances are different. So if, like some on social media, you have not made up your mind, this should help you. Stanky leg:  Gwara gwara:  You're welcome.
