The Kenilworth Racecourse was the place to be on Saturday as horse-racing fanatics, celebrities and fashion fundis gathered for the second instalment of the Sun Met Celebrated with GH Mumm. The African skies played along, allowing revellers to show off their African prints per the theme 'Style Ahead of the Field'. Celebrities came in their interpretations of the themes and as always, slayed the red carpet. Here are some of our favourite looks: The #SunMet is underway and the Kenilworth Racecourse is thee place to be. Laughter, beauty Queens and do gorgeousness!
