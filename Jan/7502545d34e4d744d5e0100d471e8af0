The ArchDaily's 2018 Building of the Year Awards long list has been announced - an utterly overwhelming collection of 3,500 of the world's most impressive structures - and South Africa is competing with the best of them. Nearly 20 projects from South Africa are in the running for the prize this year, which 'recognizes and rewards the projects that are making an impact in the profession'.
