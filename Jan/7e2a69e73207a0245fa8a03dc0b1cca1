What a way to welcome 2018! A spectacular so-called “supermoon” rose high in the sky on New Year’s Day, and stargazers around the world were on hand to snap some truly stunning shots of the celestial display: Supermoons happen “when a full moon occurs at or near the perigee,” per NASA. “It looks slightly larger and brighter than a typical full moon.” The next supermoon, which has been dubbed a “super blue blood moon,” will rise on the night of Jan. 31.
