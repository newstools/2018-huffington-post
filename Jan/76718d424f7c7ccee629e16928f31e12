When a great musician passes on, my first reaction is always to play the music 🎶 that they left behind for us to remember them by. I want that for my music, when I die .... like the iconic Ray Phiri 🙏🏼 I had the privilege of working with him on the ANC 💯 year celebration and spent a lot of time picking his brain and soaking up as much info as I could. Every time he had seen me since then (2012) he was always so keen to tell me how well I was doing. He was charismatic, colorful, funny, deep, intelligent and undoubtedly one of the greatest songwriters in the history of African Music 🇿🇦🔝 He was even sought out by Paul Simon to work on Graceland. REST IN PEACE "UNCLE RAY" PHIRI. Your music will live forever! 🔝 🔝 LEVEL 🌍®   Here are some of the reactions:    You can listen to the song here.
