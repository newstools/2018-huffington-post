A cheesy action-film director couldn’t have staged this any better. But this car crashing into the second floor of a building was real. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured. A speeding car driven by a man authorities said had been using drugs soared off a median divider and into a second-floor dental office in Santa Ana, California, early Sunday. And the vehicle lodged there as cops and rescuers arrived to extinguish a small fire and help extract one of the occupants, the Orange County Fire Authority noted in a series of tweets. Another car occupant exited unassisted. Both had minor injuries. “The driver, who admitted to using narcotics, will be admitted to a local hospital for observation,” Fire Authority said in a statement, per the Orange County Register. Authorities are pursuing a DUI charge against the driver, whose name wasn’t released, police told the newspaper. OCFA on scene in SANTA ANA of a vehicle into a building.

Police said a dirt mound in the median contributed to the car flying so high, according to ABC’s Los Angeles affiliate. Here is obstructed surveillance video of the wreck.
