President Donald Trump hit back at critics who have questioned his mental stability by branding himself a "very stable genius" on Saturday morning. In a series of tweets, Trump said that throughout his life his "two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart." He also bragged about going from "VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star... to President of the United States (on my first try)." Trump's comment about his mental stability appeared to reference reporters questioning the president's "mental fitness" during a White House press briefing this week. Democratic lawmakershave also previously called for Trump to undergo a psychological evaluation, and Michael Wolff alleges in his new book, Fire and Fury, that White House aides openly question the president's mental health. Trump is set to undergo a medical examination with White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson next Friday, although it will likely focus more on his physical health. Walter Shaub, who quit as head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July, said the tweets themselves "might be enough to lead the board of any corporation to call an emergency meeting on its CEO's mental status." Other Twitter users seemed like they couldn't quite believe the posts:
