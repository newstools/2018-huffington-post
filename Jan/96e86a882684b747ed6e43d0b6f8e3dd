So what would most of us look like if we found ourselves basking in the radiant glow that (most likely) emits from the Earth angel known as Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter? Probably like this: Last night Beyoncé posted a few photos of herself and husband Jay Z at the 2018 Grammys. A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Jan 28, 2018 at 3:10pm PST One of these photos includes a stunned woman standing behind the couple as they pose for a photo backstage. Her face is pretty much the definition of the phrase "this is all of us." Needless to say, the photo soon became a very relatable meme on Twitter. Thanks for not cropping, Bey!
