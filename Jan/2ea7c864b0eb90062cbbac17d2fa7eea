President Jacob Zuma is hurt when ANC cadres abuse his name, ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe said, eNCA reported on Saturday. "I want comrades to disabuse themselves of abusing Zuma for their own purpose. They must stop it because it is dangerous to the movement, it hurts comrade Zuma," Mantashe said as the newly elected top six executive members paid their respects to struggle icon Oliver Tambo at his memorial site in Wattville, Ekurhuleni. I've worked with him for 10 years, I can write a chapter in the book I am going to write about those 10 years....People must not abuse his name to cover their own, that's my appeal," said Mantashe. He was responding to fresh demands for the ANC to recall Zuma as the country's president.
