Children's career aspirations from as young as seven are often based on gender stereotypes, a new report reveals. Named Drawing The Future, the report, drawn up by a U.K.-based charity Education and Employers, asked primary-school children aged seven to 11 what they wanted to become when they were older. They were asked to draw their ideal future job and what influenced them in their answer. Over 20,000 entries were received from the U.K., Pakistan, China and African countries that included Uganda and Zambia.       To determine the factors influencing career choices, the survey also asked participants whether they personally knew anyone who did the job, and if not, how they knew about the job, as well as their favourite subject. These were the key findings of the report:  "Drawing the Future demonstrates the need for primary school-age children to have more exposure to role models from the world of work from an early age. This is vital to ensure that children better understand the world they are growing up in, are aware of the vast range of career options open to them, and are not ruling things out at an early age," said Nick Chambers, Education and Employer's CEO. "The drawings also show clear gender patterns. But there is a simple solution that is easy to implement. All children, regardless of their social background, where they live or the jobs their parents do, should have the same chance to meet people doing a wide range of jobs to help them understand the vast opportunities open to them. It is something governments and policy makers around the world should give much more consideration," said Andreas Schleicher, director for education and skills at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
