Preshalin Naidoo's car collided with Mhere's on William Nicol Drive in Fourways in the early hours of the morning.

In reaching his decision‚ Mahango also said he could not ignore the evidence of Car Track‚ a company that had recorded Naidoo's speed from when he started driving his car the night before the incident, until the next morning when it occurred. Mhere's father, Joseph, who was also in the car, survived the crash.
