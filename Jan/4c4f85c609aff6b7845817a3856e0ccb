According to News24, family spokesperson Victor Dlamini said Madikizela-Mandela is expected to make a full recovery. "She is constantly surrounded by family and is in high spirits. The family will keep the public informed of any developments," he reportedly said. Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to hospital last year for a procedure on her knee. She was admitted to hospital in 2011 for diabetes and for minor surgery on her ankle, according to IOL. Well wishes poured in for the former wife of Nelson Mandela on social media.
