Former U.S. President Barack Obama has been closing out 2017 by trying to lift Americans’ spirits. Earlier this week, Obama tweeted a list of uplifting news stories to remind Americans about “what went right” in 2017 ― a year that saw political upheaval, natural disasters and some of the worst mass shootings in modern American history.  On New Year’s Eve, Obama took a moment to share the best books he read and songs he listened to over the past year.  “During my presidency, I started a tradition of sharing my reading lists and playlists. It was a nice way to reflect on the works that resonated with me and lift up authors and artists from around the world,” Obama wrote in a post shared on Facebook. “With some extra time on my hands this year to catch up, I wanted to share the books and music that I enjoyed most.” Take a look at the list below:
