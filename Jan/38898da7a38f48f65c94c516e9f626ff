It is unclear whether or not the Gupta family is in South Africa, after attempts to enquire about their whereabouts and get reaction to the publication of the terms of reference for the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture were unsuccessful on Friday. So HuffPost decided to embark on a mission to find the Guptas. First Leg -- Saxonworld Mansion When reporters arrived at the Gupta mansion in Saxonworld, private security immediately reprimanded them. "Stop recording me. Your f**king privacy [sic]. You are not allowed to do that... That's the law. They can lock you up for that," a private security guard screamed at reporters outside the family's mansion in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. "If you don't believe me, you can meet me at the police station."

Second Leg -- Trillian HuffPost then made its way to Trillian's office's in Melrose Arch. When a reporter asked where the Guptas were via an intercom, the reception immediately slammed the phone down. A second call was ignored.  Third Leg -- Sahara Sahara Computers, meanwhile, was fenced. When a reporter asked security guards the same questions, the response was: "The Guptas are not in the premises, go try at Saxonworld." #WhereAreTheGuptas it's seems the Guptas arent at Sahara.

Guards were angry when asked about the whereabouts of the Guptas. HuffPost was ordered to leave the premises.   Attempts to secure an interview with Atul, Ajay or Tony Gupta were unsuccessful. It is unclear where they are, or what their reaction to the commission's terms is.Gert van der Merwe, the Guptas' lawyer, was not immediately available for comment. Gary Naidoo, who used to be the family's spokesperson, could also not shed light on where the Guptas are, or who speaks on behalf of the family. A request for comment has been forwarded to Oakbay, the Guptas' holding company.
