On the second day of the HoÃ«rskool Overvaal protest, there was a strong police presence at the school, as parents and protesters clashed outside. Surprisingly, there are no EFF members reported at the scene.   According to transformation committee's Mofokeng Tlhorsothere, a voice note has been circulating in which a group of white parents urged all white people to unite against protesters.   Tensions were high, and there were reports of heavily-armed farmers outside the school and clashes between parents and protesters.   Police presence had increased outside the embattled school by Thursday morning -- with about 10 police vehicles parked outside the school's main entrance. Some SAPS officials are patrolling the premises on motorbikes -- the situation seemed to have calmed down, and EFF members were nowhere to be seen.
