Former Bafana Bafana footballer Mark Fish perhaps scored one of the biggest own goals of his post-football career when he mistakenly tweeted: "So sad to here [sic] about Hugh Masekela....You will always remain close in our hearts...We love you!!" with a picture of Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse, confusing him with the late Masekela, who succumbed to cancer on Tuesday. Fish deleted the tweet as soon as he realised his blunder; however, Mabuse did not hold back and reminded Fish that he was still "very much alive... oops". Sorry guys wrong pic!!  #MarkFish I am very much alive - oops ask my family or manager @MartinMyers or @BillyMonama - I am alive and well pic.twitter.com/5MWU2Hyhup Fish later rectified his mistake with the correct image, this time with the caption reading: "We love you Hugh and thank you for the awesome memories".
