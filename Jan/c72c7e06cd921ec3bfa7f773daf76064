President Donald Trump's "fake news" awards didn't get off to a great start on Wednesday when they crashed the GOP's servers. And it didn't get much better from there. Much of the reaction on social media centered on the president's own reputation for "fake news." The Washington Post earlier this month reported that Trump has made more than 2,000 false or misleading claims in his first 355 days in office. Others mockingly wished to win the awards themselves or cracked jokes. And still others called Trump the "#FakePresident." Here is some of that reaction: And the #FakeNews awards go t... correction, the #FakePresident Award goes to #Trump. Over 2,000 documented proven lies in his first year. #FakeNewsAwards When your website accidentally nails it.#FakeNewsAwardspic.twitter.com/mq3Fa5dapP TIL: For all his screaming about fake news, Trump wasn't able to find any truly serious/uncorrected mistakes in the mainstream media. The lies he tells on Twitter each day are far worse and a lot more dangerous #FakeNewsAwards As it turns out, many #MAGAphones are starting to figure out that the #FakeNewsAward should go to their fake president, that proclaimed he would drain the swamp. As it turns out, the swamp is the ONLY ecosystem he's protected. pic.twitter.com/rHyzEr31gu Man, all I got was a #FakePresident*. https://t.co/X2d7XGOl8Y üëãüëãüëãüëã

Donald Tonight‚ÄºÔ∏è

#FakeNewsAwardspic.twitter.com/XybLSW6sQB Just 51 hours until the government shuts down, and the GOP is more focused on their #FakeNewsAwards than doing their own jobs. Not only does the GOP control every branch of government, but Trump refused to sign their bi-partisan bill. As always, they will try to blame the Dems. I nominate @washingtonpost for this junior high book report full of ignorant falsehoods. #FakeNewsAwardspic.twitter.com/m0zxmQxbMK WE WERE ROBBED! https://t.co/JdKLUZ5aIp#FakeNewsAwardspic.twitter.com/HOd2ER7CaO @seanhannity was robbed! His work on the Seth Rich story was the most underrated fake news of the year. Tonight, @realDonaldTrump released his long-promised #FakeNewsAwards.

History may have forgotten it, but another notable world leader had a famous conflict with the press: Hitler. pic.twitter.com/vm76z6lGfE I'd love for BuzzFeed to win, but really it's an honor to just live under an administration that devalues the press pic.twitter.com/ylg0HGBAaN So,did @FoxNews sweep the #FakeNewsAwards ? In response to Trump's #FakeNewsAwards, CPJ on January 8 announced #PressOppressors awards #TheFakieshttps://t.co/BGL3oaBrSq Can't handle how embarassing this Fake News Awards list is. It's the definition of a snowflake nitpicking minor errors while 99% of Trump's statements are flat out lies.

I mean, holy sh*t, "Trump dumps box of fish food" is one of his top ten "fake news" topics.

So embarassing. The presidents's #FakeNewsAwards is just the latest in a long list of attacks against our First Amendment's freedom of the press.

No really, we have a list. https://t.co/4UY91noUTJ And the winner of #FakeNewsAwards is... 404 Error (guess Moscow server is down for maintenance) pic.twitter.com/nEq7rEZAnU Share this slide:
