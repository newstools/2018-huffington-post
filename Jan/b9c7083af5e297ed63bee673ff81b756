Umalusi Council approves 2017 matric results The Umalusi council signed off on the results of the Matric Class of 2017 on Friday, December 29, 2017. This was a critical step on the road to the release of the matric results on Thursday morning. No leaked papers; no systemic irregularities At the media briefing, Professor John Volmink, chairperson of the Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further Education and Training (Umalusi), said that for the first time in many years, there was no leaking of exam papers –– and there were also no systemic irregularities in the exam process. Real improvement in results Professor Volmink said that there was an improvement in the quality of the question papers. There was an increase in the raw marks –– meaning that on average, students simply did better than in previous years. There was a steady upward trend in subjects such as mathematics, mathematics literacy, physical science and life sciences. According to Professor Volmink, this improvement in the results meant that Umalusi was able to leave the subject marks unadjusted. Of the 58 subjects, the results for 38 subjects were accepted without any adjustments.
