New Year, new meme ― that must have been John Mayer’s thought on Sunday. The singer posted a shirtless photo on Instagram showing himself wearing the type of high-waisted pants that Adam Driver’s character Kylo Ren shows off in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” Along with the photo, Mayer posted the hashtag #kylorenchallenge. Based on the reaction, it looks like the challenge was accepted.   Some people really took the high-waisted look to a new level. Others just wanted to be a part of something bigger than themselves.
