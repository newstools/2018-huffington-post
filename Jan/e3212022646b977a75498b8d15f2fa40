Pop superstar Madonna announced on Thursday morning that she will be building four more schools in Malawi this year, bringing the sum total of her school-building efforts in the cash-strapped nation to 12. The "Like A Virgin" hitmaker made the announcement on Instagram, asking followers to "Be The Change" they want to see in the world. "Let's start 2018 off right! 🎉🌈💕! I'm challenging you all to stand up, come together and BE the CHANGE you want to SEE in the World! 🌍 ♥️🌍! This year we'll begin by building 4 brand-new schools in the Kasungu District of #Malawi," she said in the post.  Madonna is mother to an adopted child from Malawi, and she has since put significant effort into building schools and hospitals throughout the country.
