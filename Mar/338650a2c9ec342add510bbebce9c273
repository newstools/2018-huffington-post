A Cameroon-born actor says he almost lost an eye on Saturday after a white woman assaulted him at a restaurant in Madrid. Marius Makon, who is also known as Elton Prince, told the Spanish newspaper El Pais he was ordering coffee with friends when a couple approached him. Makon said the woman, who police later described as a 32-year-old from El Salvador, told him, "I don't want black people in this place or in front of me." Makon said he told the woman he'd be leaving in a moment and added, "I don't have any interest in staying near you for long." The woman allegedly called Makon a "black piece of shit." According to The Washington Post, she said: "I'm white. I can kill you and nothing will happen." The woman allegedly smashed a beer bottle against the actor's head twice, causing cuts and other injuries that required medical attention.

After witnesses identified the suspect, Makon filed a report at the local police station. The woman was arrested, according to The Associated Press, but was released shortly after she provided a statement to police, according to El Pais. Makon went into detail about the incident on his Facebook page, and said he does not feel any hatred toward his assailant: Now I am in my house and I look through these images [of my injuries] I do not feel any hate towards the woman. I want to say that I am not angry with her and I don't know why. I am sad that she feels such hate, that she lives with hate. It saddens me that she does not enjoy life, that she doesn't leave a small space in her heart to love. Spain's Migration Network, a group of nongovernmental organizations and groups fighting discrimination, is asking prosecutors to investigate the incident as a hate crime. However, the Civil Liberties Union for Europe notes that Spain does not have "any comprehensive and united policy against racism." About 1 million people of African origin live in Spain and deal with frequent racism, according to El Pais. Share this slide:
