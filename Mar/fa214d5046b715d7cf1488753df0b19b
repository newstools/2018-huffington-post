The blogs desk boasted myriad blogs this week, covering some of the pressing issues that took centre stage in the country's news and politics spheres. And some contributors touched on concerns facing the aspirational generation, in the form of lifestyle pressures and general life hacks. Take some time out of your morning, grab a cuppa and dig into this hot serving of blogs: 1. SA Media Can Be A Pain In The Neck... And Rightly So! German ambassador Martin Schaefer shares about his experiences in office, neck pain, journalists and ballerinas. He emphasises the great deal of work done by journalists to ensure that politicians and government are held to account and says that even though journos have proven to be a formidable pain in the neck sometimes, they have managed to ensure that democracy is upheld.
