The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) has urged South Africans to continue being sceptical of any investment that seems too good to be true, so as not to be deceived by "investments" that promise quick, high and guaranteed returns. "Scamsters will go to great lengths to get victims to invest in these schemes through the use of social engineering tactics," said Sabric chief executive Kalyani Pillay. "They will even come up with convincing, fabricated statistics to make their offer look attractive, so always treat these kinds of schemes with suspicion," she added.
