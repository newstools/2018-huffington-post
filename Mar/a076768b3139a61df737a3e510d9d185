Eastern Cape-born musician, author and actor Nakhane dropped a new music video on Thursday night, and we are losing it for his seductive, glittering visuals. The new single, called "Interloper", sees Nakhane appear in a silver sequinned suit singing evocative lyrics like "When last did you go to Bacchanalia?". Later the artist is covered in a sea of bodies, who are all groping and reaching for him.
