This kid has a future. Carden Corts became a viral sensation this week after a video was posted online showing him deliver a weather forecast as only a 6-year-old can. In a little more than a day, Carden's video racked up more than 1 million views on YouTube. Not bad for a kindergarten project. The children in Carden's class were each asked to make a weather forecast video for a school assignment. His dad, Charlie, happens to work at a design studio with a green screen. "When I saw this assignment, I felt like I had been waiting my whole life for this," Charlie told the Tennessean. "No seriously, I thought it was something we could have fun with." They certainly did. Check it out above. Share this slide:
