Jennifer Lopez has shared her experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace, revealing she was treated inappropriately by a director in the early days of her film career. In the wake of the #MeToo and 'Time's Up' movements, which were founded after many women in Hollywood coming forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against high-profile men, Jennifer was asked whether this was a subject that directly affected her during an interview with Harper's Bazaar. She told the magazine: "I haven't been abused in the way some women have. But have I been told by a director to take off my shirt and show my boobs? Yes, I have. But did I do it? No, I did not." Jennifer went on to say she was "terrified" at the prospect of "speaking up" at the time, but did put the unidentified director in his place. "I remember my heart beating out of my chest, thinking, 'What did I do? This man is hiring me!'," Jennifer revealed. "It was one of my first movies. But in my mind I knew the behaviour wasn't right. "It could have gone either way for me. But I think ultimately the Bronx in me was like, 'Nah, we're not having it'." Back in January, on the day of the Golden Globes black dress protest, Jennifer delivered a powerful and emotionally-charged speech in support of the 'Time's Up' movement and equality in Puerto Rico. "I stand here today in black [supporting 'Time's Up'] from far away," she told those in attendance. "It's the same thing with here in Puerto Rico, we want to be treated equally." The 'Time's Up' initiative, set up earlier this year, has already raised millions to help cover legal fees for the victims of workplace sexual harassment across all industries.
