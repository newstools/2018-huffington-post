One of the most popular multiplayer video games Fortnite Battle Royale is going to be released on iOS and Android this year. Considering the game already has over 45 million players on Xbox One, PS4, PC and Mac the addition of iPhones and Android smartphones means we’ll probably have another Pokemon Go on our hands. The free-to-play game has seen phenomenal success thanks to its cartoon like graphics and the addictive gameplay which sees 100 players fight it out on a single giant map until only one person can be claimed as the winner. You can actually start playing Fortnite on your iOS device right now as part of the developer’s pilot program although you’ll need to head to this link to register. If by some incredible fluke you’re able to actually register be warned, Fortnite is a fully-fledged video game so it won’t just run on any old Apple device. You’ll need an iPhone 6S/SE or newer and iPad Mini 4 or newer iPad for it to run as well as having the latest version of iOS installed. It’s not clear when the pilot program will start nor is it clear on how long the program is planning on running. In what might be one of the shrewdest business decisions we’ve ever seen Fortnite’s developers Epic Games announced last year that it would be launching a free-to-play version of the game called Battle Royale. Set in a huge map this version of the game puts 100 players against each other. The players then have to fight each other all the while contending with the fact that the map is shrinking. To win the game you have to be the last person standing, either through hiding or by eliminating everyone else in your way. The premise of the game is almost identical to that of Player Unknown Battlegrounds (PUBG), another online game that has seen huge popularity on PC and Xbox One. Unlike PUBG however, Fortnite Battle Royale is completely free.
