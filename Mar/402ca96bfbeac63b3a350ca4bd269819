Trevor Noah thinks he's pinpointed one of U.S. President Donald Trump's conditions. In a behind-the-scenes clip published online by "The Daily Show" on Tuesday, the comedian lightheartedly suggested that Trump was suffering from "xenophobic FOMO" (fear of missing out). As evidence, Noah used Trump's idea to make his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall see-through, so that officials can check whether cartel members are on the other side. "That's, like, such a weird thing to say," Noah said. "That's like saying, 'I need my wall to my neighbour to be see-through, because what if my neighbour is jacking off, then I won't know?'"
