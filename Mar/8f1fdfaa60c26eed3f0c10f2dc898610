U.S. President Donald Trump thinks his country should launch a "Space Force," a branch of the military devoted to wars in space. "Space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air and sea," Trump said on Tuesday at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. "We may even have a Space Force, develop another one, Space Force. We have the Air Force, we'll have the Space Force." At first, Trump said he wasn't serious about the notion. "Then I said, 'What a great idea!' Maybe we'll have to do that,'" Trump said. "So think of that: Space Force, because we are spending a lot and we have a lot of private money coming in, tremendous." He also described the U.S. military as "vital to ensuring America continues to lead the way into the stars." For the moment, however, his idea for a Space Force led to much laughter on Twitter: I see this in our future. pic.twitter.com/KE91wKnNRx We call it a "Death Star" in my galaxy https://t.co/GqK9E0EzTr Breaking: Trump taps Darth Vader to lead his #SpaceForce. pic.twitter.com/ygv81MKonq Somewhere @HamillHimself mentally prepares for the inevitable: a phone call from the President*, asking him to lead the new #SpaceForce thanks to his "years of experience fighting bad guys in space" #ImpeachTrump#DumbDonald#TuesdayThoughts #spaceforce Trumps gonna put a "laser" on the Moon.

He doesn't want any kind of alien entering the U.S. "They're bringing laser swords, they're bringing pod people, they're face huggers and some of them I'm sure are fine extra terrestrials." #spaceforce LOLOL #SpaceForce#SpaceBallspic.twitter.com/cgIoQewu3A Finally. It's happening.

Cabinet: "But why tho"
Trump: "Have you seen the documentaries lately about space? The one with Mark Hamill?"
Cabinet: "...Sir that's Star Wars."
Trump: "See, the war has already started!" #SpaceForce You are entering another dimension.
Welcome to The Space Force.
