The South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) ceremonies are underway in Sun City. Night one of the awards ceremony celebrates excellence within the technical craft of the industry, which is made up of men and women who are the backbone of the industry. Phat Joe hosted the evening. In congratulating the winners, NFVF CEO Zama Nkosi said it's important for the industry to celebrate people who play a crucial role in the journey of creating the magic we see on the screens daily. "Today's winners are an integral part of translating South Africa's golden stories into entertaining and thought-provoking conversation pieces," she said. Night two, which will be on Saturday, will be broadcast live on SABC2 from 8pm. Over 40 awards were handed out on the night and here are the winners.
