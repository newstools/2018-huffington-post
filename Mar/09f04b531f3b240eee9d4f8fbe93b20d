Former White House photographer Pete Souza isn't letting up. On Wednesday, the Obama-era snapper once again used a throwback Instagram photograph to subtly take aim at President Donald Trump. This time, Souza appeared to mock Trump over his use of "a big word." A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Mar 21, 2018 at 2:40pm PDT "Excoriate is a big word," Souza captioned a 2010 photograph of former President Barack Obama playing basketball. "Energy isn't â€• some people have it, and others just say they have it," he added. Trump used the word in a tweet in which he defended calling Russian President Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his election victory: Earlier this month, Souza took an implicit dig at Trump over the way in which the president reportedly fired former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
