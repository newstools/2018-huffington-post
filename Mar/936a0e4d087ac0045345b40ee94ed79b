Reigning Miss South Africa Adè van Heerden has taken to Instagram to express her gratitude following a car accident she was involved in on Sunday. At the time of the accident, which happened in Randpark Ridge, Adè was driving the Nissan X Trail she received as part of her prize package when she took over as the reigning Miss SA in November, following Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters' Miss Universe win. She said she was grateful and felt blessed to be alive. "I was involved in a very horrible car accident and through God's protection managed to escape with only a few bruises. I know that if I wasn't in a safe car where all the airbags deployed like my Nissan X-trail, the situation would've been a lot different (sic)," she said in her post.
