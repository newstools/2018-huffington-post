If youâ€™re an introvert,Â you likely value your alone time. You think before you speak. Youâ€™d much rather socialize one-on-one than in a group. A phone call is probably your worst nightmare. But most of all, you areÂ silently strong. It can be tough to prefer to be alone in a world that values boldness and extroversion. But take heart, quiet types: Twitter has your back. Each month weÂ round up spot-on tweets that capture what itâ€™s like to be an introvert. Scroll down for our latest batch. People who cancel our plans before I get up the courage to cancel them myself are my kind of people. Ever pretended to be on a phone call to avoid actual interaction? No? Just me? pic.twitter.com/24fZfwFkdG As an introvert, most of the conversations Iâ€™ve ever had are imaginary. Just what the doctor ordered!  #introvert #introvertlife #introvertproblems pic.twitter.com/LEmgsRMC3y I have to wait until the coast is clear.My book, Quiet Girl in a Noisy World, is out now: https://t.co/OeNAnhakVM#comics #introvert pic.twitter.com/urypk0RgU2 I just stepped out a door, forgot there was a mirror and not realising it was my own reflection refused to make eye contact with myself #introvertproblems Just invited my brother and sister-in-law over for pizza and this was the reply. #Introverts pic.twitter.com/RduJxrnCDK I had to people today. So. Much. Small. Talk.If anyone needs me I will be sitting in silence with a book until my brain resets.#introvertproblems I want to go in Starbucks but I saw someone I know and I donâ€™t want to indulge in an awkward conversation with them. #introvertproblems I'm so witty in the conversations i have with myself.  Just never translates over into real life.  #introvertproblems When you walk into @dunkindonuts and the guy says, "hey, don't you usually drive thru?"And all you can think is "time to find a new coffee stop."  ðŸ˜‚#IntrovertProblems I want tea, but there's a Person in my house and I'm wearing holey sweatpants. #introvertproblems #strugglebus #tea Omg someone just knocked on a door on TV and I thought it was my apartment door and I nearly had a heart attack. #introvertproblems One evening 2 introverts met at a bar. Nobody started a conversation. Both had a lovely evening. ðŸ˜‚#introvertlife #introvert #introvertgoals #introvertproblems I used to hate people who use meeting rooms as their personal office but I've seen the light.
