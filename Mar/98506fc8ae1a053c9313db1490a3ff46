When you're CÃ©line Dion and you turn 50, if you can't perform, the show must still go on - at least on social media. Canada's favourite chanteuse is currently on a leave from her Caesar's Palace residency in Las Vegas, and has cancelled her performances through April 18, as she recovers from a surgical procedure to correct an ear condition. So, to celebrate her milestone birthday, Dion treated fans to an adorable throwback photo of a younger her in a pink frilly dress on Instagram, and a Facebook video montage of some of her favourite memories, set to a medley of her biggest hits. ðŸ’« JOYEUX 50e ANNIVERSAIRE CÃ‰LINE! ðŸ’« De sa premiÃ¨re chanson Ã©crite par sa maman et son frÃ¨re, jusqu'Ã  aujourd'hui, nous nous remÃ©morons quelques-uns des moments les plus prÃ©cieux de la vie personnelle et professionnelle de CÃ©line.
