It tells the story of 28-year-old Lou, a modern urban gal who is told she's been promised to the Zulu king in marriage, to repay an ancestral debt. She is forced to confront the tradition she's been running away from since the death of her parents when she turned 15.  In a recent interview with HuffPost, actor and producer Thabo Rametsi said he believes South Africa makes some of the best movies in the world. He said for the local movie industry to grow, it's up to consumers to go out and support movies when they are released. "If you go to any cinema and see South African movie posters, most of them have these little brackets on the side. We ignore them because we're not really a film nation, but those brackets tell us how many film festivals a movie has been chosen to show in, as well as the number of awards it has won. If you look carefully, you'll see that all our South African movies have those. Maybe seven out of 10 of our films have one of those, which tells how great we are," Rametsi said. He said that although there are minor distribution issues that need to be fixed on the side of producers, local support is a good start. "If our people could go out and watch the films we put out now, we'd be able to get even more funding â€“ to deliver to them the kind of movies that will compete with the likes of 'Black Panther', he said.
