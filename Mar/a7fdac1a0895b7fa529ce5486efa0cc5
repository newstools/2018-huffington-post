PeepsIt started with a tweet by the people's doctor, Sindi van Zyl saying #SundayTwitter would be dedicated to celebrating teachers. Tomorrow we are dedicating #SundayTwitter to teachers.
I shall be up at the crack of dawn to get us started. We do not appreciate the work that is done by teachers. That wall that I saw at Manie's school reminded me of the magic that teachers are #WeLoveTeachers  #WeLoveTeachers became a prominent trend, as people poured their hearts out about teachers and why they are such amazing humans. Thank you! We did it! #WeLoveTeachers 💗💗💗 pic.twitter.com/P1kpLPy7B7 Tweeps were feeling warm and fuzzy... So sweet! #WeLoveTeachers

A big shutout to my H.S. maths teacher, Mrs Waters. Forced me to deal with a subject I detested. Forced all of her "bad" students to take extra classes after school-hours.

Turned an indifferent, lethargic, maths student into a numbers man.  This is my Mother wit her last class she taught.She used to say teaching is not a profession but a calling.She refused teach in the suburbs & taught in the villages. She stayed in a school cottage & came home only on Fridays.
She died at the age of 45 in 2010. 🖤 #WeLoveTeachers pic.twitter.com/JNUOZf2L4X  Today is her Birthday..
Rest is perfect peace Mom 🖤
○18.03.1965 >> ●15.08.2010#WeLoveTeachers My mom is a teacher & literally, she is always teaching. My nieces & nephews are all top achievers in their schools because mom made education fun for them. My nephews count everything! "10 more spoons & then I'm full Gogo" & he can even count backwards now 🤣❤️ #WeLoveTeachers #WeLoveTeachers
