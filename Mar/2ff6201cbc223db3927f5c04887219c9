Come August 25 and 26, South African artists Nakhane (of "Inxeba" fame), Sho Madjozi and Manthe Ribane will take to the stage at the Afropunk festival in Brooklyn, New York, in the United States.  Afropunk recently published its lineups for Brooklyn, Atlanta and Paris. Nakhane has been booked for the Brooklyn and Paris shows. In New York, the three South Africans will share the stage with, among others, Erykah Badu, Janelle Mon√°e and Miguel.  Congratulations to the trio. South Africa is so proud.
