Pearl Thusi has shut the show down with her incredible images in a subway station in New York. The "Quantico" star is no stranger to the Big Apple – she's a regular visitor with her celebrity pals like DJ Zinhle. On Thursday, Thusi dropped the images on Instagram, and fans are loving the looks. Missed the glam? Not to worry, we have you covered: We don't see things as they are. We see them as we are. — Anais Nin A post shared by  Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Mar 7, 2018 at 1:19am PST  Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, "I'll try again tomorrow." –Maryanne Radmacher A post shared by  Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Mar 7, 2018 at 1:16am PST  It matters not Who you love, Where you love, Why you love, When you love, Or how you love, It matters only that you love. — John Lennon 📸 @underground_nyc 👠 @europaart 👗 @casperdesigner 💁🏽‍♀️ @_blackpearlhair A post shared by  Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Mar 5, 2018 at 11:51pm PST  Mood.
