As Human Rights Day approaches, artist Lady Skollie along with the Ntethelelo Foundation have geared up to use creativity as a form of activism. The project includes working closely with 20 girls from the Ntethelelo Foundation's youth programme in Sitjwetla, an informal settlement near Alexandra. The Johannesburg-based artist ran workshops to help the girls creatively connect their lived experiences within their communities to their rights as stated in the constitution.

This is where the youth teams shared their experience of human-rights violations, exploring remedies for those scenarios using the constitution. The full project will showcase at the Constitution Hill from March 23-25 during the upcoming Human Rights Festival, which is focused on visual art and drama as a tool to unpack themes of gender-based violence and the rights of children. Any proceeds raised will be shared between the girls and the foundation, which will use the funds to buy a creative workshop space for the learners.
