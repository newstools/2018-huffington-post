  British people consume more chocolate than those in any other country, a new report from Mintel has found. In 2017, the average Brit munched through a whopping 8.4kg of chocolate - which isn't great news for the nation's blood sugar levels. In Switzerland, which could be considered the capital of chocolate (hello, Toblerone), the average person put away 8.3kg of chocolate, while in Germany they consumed 8.2kg on average. According to the report, the U.K. has also seen a spike in the number of alcohol-flavoured Easter eggs Brits are eating, such as gin-and-tonic flavoured eggs, which HuffPost can confirm definitely don't live up to the hype. It seems the British love of chocolate isn't dying down anytime soon. With Easter fast approaching, things are likely not going to stop now.
