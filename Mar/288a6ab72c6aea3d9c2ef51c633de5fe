Same theme song, same kitchen, same laugh — even Laurie Metcalf looks the same! But the opening sequence for the revival of ABC's long-running sitcom "Roseanne" does offer something new — a sneak peek at the extended Conner family gathering around the table for a meal. One of these new family members is Roseanne Conner's grandson, Mark (Ames McNamara), who likes to dress in clothing traditionally worn by girls. "I don't want to pigeonhole him and say just because he dresses this way, that's the only thing about him," executive producer Sara Gilbert, who also plays Darlene Conner, told Entertainment Weekly in January. "He happens to dress that way, but he's an amazing, creative, brilliant kid, which you will see, and so is the kid, Ames, who plays him." The character backs up the reboot's promise to address issues affecting today's working-class American families. "Roseanne," set to premiere at 8 p.m. on March 27, also features returning cast members Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Lecy Goranson, Michael Fishman, Sarah Chalke, Metcalf, Gilbert, and ― from the looks of the opening credits ― Roseanne's beloved rooster shirt.
