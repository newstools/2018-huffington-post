Barbra Streisand said she has "never" been sexually harassed, suggesting that her appearance had something to do with it. The 75-year-old singer, actress and director was asked during a tribute to her at PaleyFest in Los Angeles whether she had been the victim of sexual misconduct. "Never," she answered Friday, according to news outlets. "I wasn't like those pretty girls with nice little noses. Maybe that's why." Addressing the #MeToo movement, Streisand added: "We're in a strange time now, in terms of men and women and the pendulum swinging this way and that way, and it's going to have to come to the centre." Streisand has said in the past that she believed sexism in Hollywood prevented her from receiving an Oscar nomination for directing. She recently chastised the Golden Globes for its lack of female director winners, declaring at the January awards ceremony, "Time's up!" At PaleyFest, the performer said her most satisfying moments in entertainment have come as a director. "That is such a complete experience," she said, according to Entertainment Weekly. "It just involves every sense you have, every nerve end. Your taste or your vision qualities. And trying to get the best out of the actors." #Paleyfest opening night has concluded, with @BarbraStreisand receiving an honor for her TV career. pic.twitter.com/GX7c5zOmtk Share this slide:
