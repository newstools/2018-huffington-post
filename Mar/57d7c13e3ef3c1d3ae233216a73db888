Thando Thabethe says she couldn't be more excited about the release of her new film "Love Lives Here" in September this year. In the rom-com, Thando stars as Zinhle Malinga, a young novelist looking for love who is caught in the clash between modern and traditional ideas of romance. #BlackFriday ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜› #LLHMovie @lovelives_h  "She's a girl trying to navigate love and ends up finding it in the one place she least expected to find it. The film is a true reflection of the struggles women in South Africa faceâ€š a battle between what their heart wants and what society, or tradition, thinks is right. It is all about that conflict between what people say and what they want for themselves," she says.
