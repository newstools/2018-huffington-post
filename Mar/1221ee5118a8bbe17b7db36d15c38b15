Singer/songwriter and businesswoman Nandi Madida has revealed the present she bought her son Shaka on his first birthday in November last year – a piece of land. Madida took to Instagram to share the proud moment and her reasons for doing it. "This was a very proud moment for me as his mother, because this is a legacy that will last for many generations to come. It's the same as Colour (my fashion line) and the other businesses I'm a part of –which you'll soon learn about. I want my children to understand generational wealth.

I am who I am because of my parents, grandparents and my ancestors. I owe it to my kids to also play my part," Madida said on Instagram.  She said she has started building a farm for him on the land, which he will one day hand over to his children.
