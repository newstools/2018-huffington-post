Kim Kardashian said accusations that she altered a photo she posted on Instagram over the weekend are ridiculous. The reality star posted a picture captioned "Let's March" before she headed to a March for Our Lives anti-gun protest on Saturday. Fans pointed out that the car to Kardashian's left in the background of the photo looks distorted, and some accused the beauty mogul ― or someone on her team ― of editing the picture to make Kardashian look better. A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Mar 24, 2018 at 7:15am PDT So many news sites wrote articles about the reported "Photoshop fail" that Kardashian responded with a blog post on her website. "I'm seeing online and on news media outlets that I suffered a 'Photoshop fail,'" she wrote Monday. "So ridiculous! I reposted a picture on Instagram that a fan had already posted ― I only added a filter to it. It looks like the fan mirrored the photo, which is the reason the car looks like that. So, this is actually really funny to me!" Kardashian and Kanye West once spent four days editing a photo from their wedding album before posting it, so it's not unthinkable that Kardashian would alter something. The "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star typically calls out pictures that aren't edited. Two years ago, Kardashian was accused of editing her waist in Fergie's "MILF" music video. She responded to haters with a Snapchat video of her appearance on the set and a "F*ckYoPhotoShop #CorsetLife" comment.
