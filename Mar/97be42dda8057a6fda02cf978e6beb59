With a series of long weekends coming up in March, April and May, many of us will be hitting the road for a little mini-break. But what's a car trip without some pumping tunes to sing along to? Before you randomly start searching "romantic tunes", if you're going on a couple's stay, or "best songs for tweens", just stop, collaborate and listen to me, I've canvassed my team to source some of the top songs, for lovers, families, and a girl's weekend away. For the lovers: What would a romantic holiday away be without the right music to set the mood? And you might as well get into the mood the moment you get into the car.  Family favourites Some of the tunes might not be music to YOUR ears, but it's better than the "are we there yet?" chorus.  Girls' Getaway A bonding weekend with the gals is needed at least once a year, for an all-encompassing catch-up. And there's nothing quite the same as bonding as belting out tunes together.  Boys trip Going away with the crew for golfing trip or an offroad adventure? Well, you are going to need the tunes to get you in the zone.
