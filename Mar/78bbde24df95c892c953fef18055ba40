The witness added that one of the suspects was shot, before being dragged back into a getaway car. In a video doing the rounds on social media, a man dressed in a black shirt and shorts, with a balaclava over his head, can be seen standing next to a white bakkie, while firing shots at what are believed to be security officers. The man collapses while attempting to get into a moving white Ford Fiesta, bleeding profusely. The car then reverses and one of the men pulls his body into the car. #randburgshooting just now pic.twitter.com/1dudrjN7JV   #RandburgShooting A suspect was injured and fled.
