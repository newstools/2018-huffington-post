While we’ve heard a lot about self-driving taxis very few of us have actually seen one actually working, until now. Over at SXSW in the US, Google’s self-driving car company Waymo has been operating a completely driverless taxi service and to prove it they’ve actually put together some footage of some of the journeys. As you can see from the video there is no-one in the driving seat and aside from the Waymo employee that’s obliged to be there the only other occupants are the passengers. What’s really remarkable then about the video is just how unremarkable the car makes self-driving look. The car interacts with traffic, intersections and all the other daily obstacles that humans have to cope with and it does it without breaking a sweat. In fact, the car is so good at driving people around that one passenger even manages to drift off: Now to be absolutely clear, you’re not going to start seeing Waymo’s self-driving taxis filling the streets just yet. Instead this is one of those benchmark moments where a company can show us just how far it has come, and honestly, it feels like they’ve come a long way.
