How many experiences did you have as a kid that years later, when you look back on them, you laugh? Black Twitter brought all the stories out the woodwork with yesterday's #YouHaventLivedIfYou hashtag that was picked up on many feeds â€“ revealing that there is a rich thread of common experiences that make most of us laugh and ask ourselves "WTF?" when we remember them. From "#YouHaventLivedIFyou never had to hold your charger/earphones a certain way just for it to work", to "#YouHaventLivedIFyou dreamt peeing in the toilet, and woke up from the stupid dream to find the bed soaking wet. And switched sides with your sibling...", they kept coming to keep us in stitches.
