The latest attempted land grabs happened over the weekend on land belonging to Wits University in Marlboro, Johannesburg. However, HuffPost has confirmed with the university that it did not originally buy the land. The vacant land was actually given to the university by the former Transvaal government for "educational purposes". "The land was donated to the Transvaal government, who transferred the land to Wits in 1924," the university said on Monday. According to police spokesperson Captain Granville Meyer, there were two separate incidents of attempted land invasion on Saturday.
