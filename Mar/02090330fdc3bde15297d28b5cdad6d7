It would be difficult for almost anyone to turn more heads than Kelly Ripa, whose still-smitten hubby Mark Consuelos captured an Instagram picture of her wearing a bikini during the couple’s beach vacation. While almost all of the comments gushed over Consuelo’s homage to “my sexy one,” some trolls blasted the ripped 47-year-old host of ABC’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” calling her too old and too skinny. “Kelly’s gorgeous, but isn’t there a cutoff age where age-appropriateness comes into play?” read one comment. “Just because you can rock a bikini, doesn’t mean you should.” Sultry Sundays with the sexy one are my fave... A post shared by  Mark Consuelos (@instasuelos) on Mar 25, 2018 at 11:38am PDT One follower insisted: “She needs to eat something.” Another complained that she has the “body of a boy.” Most, though, were awed by her beauty (one fan een asked the trolls for their “best bikini shot.”) How does Ripa deal with it? She just doesn’t sweat the trolls. And when a nasty follower took a dig at Consuelos in an Instagram post early this month for being “short,” Ripa shot back: “He’s tall where it counts, babe.” She said later: “I love a clapback. I love a troll but I love to troll a troll.” Consuelos and Ripa met on the set of the ABC soap “All My Children,” where they played married couple Mateo Santos and Hayley Vaughan. They wed off-screen in 1996 and have three children.
