Season 2 will debut this fall, and the third season starts a year later, according to Deadline. That will bring the total number of "Will & Grace" seasons to 11 (the show previously ran on NBC from September 1998 to May 2006). "As far as I'm concerned, we can't get enough of 'Will & Grace,' and 23 more episodes is music to my ears" NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement, according to EW. It seems like audiences certainly agree.
