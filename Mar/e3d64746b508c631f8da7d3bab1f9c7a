'Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, who was addressing the land reform dialogue at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (Gibs) in Johannesburg on Tuesday, said that "anarchy must not be allowed to flourish" after speaking to a panel of speakers discussing the issue of expropriation without compensation.    "As we debate‚ we must touch the emotional aspects of land dispossession. If we don't‚ we will not heal the wounds of the past," Mantashe said. "When you restore land‚ you are not expropriating but restoring people's dignity through access to land."    Mantashe's "anarchy" comments were made in relation to the events in Hermanus in which a police station was partially burnt and a tense standoff escalated between police and "land invaders".

We must be able to trace the movement of boundaries because they were results of wars," Mantashe added. #JeremyCronin says @MYANC does not believe in full state ownership of land on lease-back as @EFFSouthAfrica does. He says EFF speaks with a forked tongue on "no compensation".  "Our interventions must not cause harm to other sectors of the economy" #LandReformDialogue  Cronin: land reform is not just about restoring stolen land but to ensure security of tenure, redistribution for productive use & for Integrated & sustainable urbanization. @TeamNews24  Conin: says public works is tasked with expropriation bill to deal with all expropriation ...tells minister Nkoana-Mashabane & Gwede Mantashe that they can go ahead & expropriate - says 6 others do too & municipalities & provinces. @TeamNews24 #landdialogue  Opinion: our land minister Maite Nkoana Mashabane has not yet had time to learn her portfolio so @GwedeMantashe1 is leading Cabinet on policy and thinking. Hers was the worst speech on land I have heard. #LandReformDialogue pic.twitter.com/HDyzUzjbbd  Bulelwa Mabasa of Werksmans Attorneys says that on land expropriation the Constitution has yet to be applied. #LandReformDialogue she adds that land was marginalised by imperative of state captures (hard truth beyond rhetoric) pic.twitter.com/MYI1TbrSqH
