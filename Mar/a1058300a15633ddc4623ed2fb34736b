Let's face it, engagement rings, as romantic as they may sound, aren't for everyone. Maybe it's their big flashy nature, or even the arbitrary linking of jewellery to a personal commitment, or even just the fear in the naturally clumsy that they'll lose it. Tattoos have been a great alternative, but now engagement piercings are gaining traction as a hot trend. The ring finger is pierced, just like an ear or a nipple â€“ and piercings can include diamonds, because there is such a thing as tradition, after all. Like most piercings, they can be customised according to your taste and personality â€“ or that of your beloved.

Extreme piercing seems to be following tattoos into the mainstream.  A post shared by Patrycja Nowak (@patrysiekk) on Feb 22, 2018 at 4:40am PST   It looks good on men's hands too.

Too deep, and the skin can grow over the piercing, but a piercing that's not deep enough will move around. Notably, removing the piercing â€“ should things go sour with your partner â€“ will leave a tiny scar.
