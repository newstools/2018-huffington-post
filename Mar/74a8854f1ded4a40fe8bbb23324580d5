Zambian immigration authorities have denied local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu entry into the country and deported her back to South African reportedly with no formal reasons given. Previously, however, when it was announced that Zodwa had been booked to perform in that country, officials banned her citing her pantiless stunts as the reason.  Although Zodwa was initially booked to perform at Karasa's album launch Saturday, the Zambian Observer reports that the National Arts Council told the promoter, Sunset Sound Production, that she could only attend as a guest because allowing her to perform was against "public interest and national values".
