A R34-million multipurpose sports arena is about to complete construction in Soweto, south of Johannesburg, and it looks like there's going to be a lot of healthy recreation ahead this winter. The Soweto Sports Arena is being built in Klipspruit, just a few metres down the road from Soweto's athletics venue, the Nike Sports Centre, and Maponya Mall. It will feature a basketball-oriented sports area, two outdoor basketball and netball pitches, a children's water pond, and other sport and play equipment. The sports complex is the fourth phase of the Nancefield Station Precinct project, a multiphased public upgrade. The complex features a number of sustainable technologies â€“ including state-of-the-art energy efficient heating, ventilation, and cooling systems, and low water-consumption sanitary fittings. #joburgworks New Multi-Purpose Soweto Sports Centre/Arena will soon be completed!
