Comedian Kevin Hart is known for his dedication to fitness. On his new web series “What The Fit,” Hart and late-night host Conan O’Brien try the Japanese martial art of sumo wrestling. First, they hit up a diner, where O’Brien carbo loads for his upcoming sumo training, all while doing whatever he can to embarrass Hart. Then it’s off to train. We know what you’re thinking: “Wait, Kevin is pretty short and Conan is super skinny. These guys can’t possibly be fit for sumo wrestling.” And you are 100 percent correct. They’re terrible. But entertaining!
