Elon Musk has joined the #DeleteFacebook movement, and we can safely assume Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg does not "like" it. Following a tweetstorm on Friday, Musk removed the official pages for SpaceX and Tesla from the social media platform, each of which had about 2.6-million followers and pretty engaged audiences. Not done there, Musk pulled his personal Facebook page and that of Tesla-owned SolarCity as well. The actions were well received on Twitter, where the multibillionaire sarcastically called out the speaker-manufacturing company Sonos, which pledged on Friday to pull its ads from Facebook and other digital companies â€• but only for a week. Brian Acton, co-founder of the now Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp (and no friend of Facebook), endorsed Musk's digital tirade with the hashtag #DeleteFacebook, to which Musk responded, "What's Facebook?" As other followers encouraged him to wipe more and more of his footprint from the site, he happily obliged: Musk followed through on his promises. Soon after making the statements, all of the pages disappeared from Facebook. In their place, only an error message remained: "Sorry, this content isn't available right now." While his Facebook presence wasn't worth a second thought, Musk drew the line at deleting his Instagram account, a Facebook-owned platform where he shares updates with just under 7-million followers. "Instagram's probably ok [in my opinion], so long as it stays fairly independent," he explained on Twitter. He also cautioned followers from blowing the Facebook deletions out of proportion. "I don't use [Facebook] and never have, so don't think I'm some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow," Musk said. "Also, we don't advertise or pay for endorsements, so ... don't care."
