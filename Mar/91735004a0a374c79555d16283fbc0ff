Beyoncé and Jay-Z don’t just run the world, they’re going to tour it together again. The first couple of hip-hop announced on Monday they are set to hit the road on their second massive joint tour, OTR II, aka On The Run 2, that will make stops in 15 cities across Europe and 21 cities in North America. The tour kicks off on June 6 in Cardiff, U.K. The pair’s last joint tour in 2014 raked in $109 million and became the subject of an HBO concert special. They since have released separate albums ― “Lemonade” and “4:44″ ― that delve heavily into the highs and lows of their decades-long relationship. The “Formation” singer was the first to break the news (and the internet), sharing a stunning black-and-white photo of herself and Jay-Z perched atop a motorcycle outfitted with a cattle skull.

The tour is presented by Live Nation Global Touring in association with Parkwood Entertainment and Roc Nation. Rumors of a joint tour have been rampant in the weeks since eagle-eyed fans discovered landing pages for various Bey and Jay tour dates on Ticketmaster. The evidence was quickly deleted, but not before the BeyHive broke into full-on social media pandemonium about the possibility of seeing their queen in concert in the near future. Beyonce, who recently welcomed twins with the rapper, has been prepping for her comeback show at next month’s two-weekend Coachella festival. She’ll likely perform the couple’s new song,“Top Off,” from DJ Khaled’s upcoming album, in which she raps about breaking the internet like it’s no big deal.
