In the U.S., “Black Panther” is officially the king of superhero films. This weekend the Marvel film became the highest domestic-grossing superhero film of all time, not accounting for inflation, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Deadline lists the movie as taking in a whopping $630.9 million. That figure passes “The Avengers,” which brought in $623.4 million in 2012. The Ryan Coogler-directed “Black Panther” should also become third highest-grossing superhero film globally, passing 2013′s “Iron Man 3” at $1.214 billion. The first two Avengers films still hold a hefty lead in worldwide gross, with “The Avengers” netting $1.5 billion, and the followup, “Avengers: Age Of Ultron,” making $1.4 billion in 2015. Unfortunately, “Black Panther” may not hold the domestic record as Marvel’s highest-grossing film for long because Marvel’s highly anticipated crossover “Avengers: Infinity Wars” comes out April 27. Presale tickets for that film are already selling at a higher rate than any superhero film ever. Until then, Wakanda forever.
