Melania Trump met with social media company and tech executives Tuesday as part of her mission to tackle cyberbullying. “It was a very productive meeting on cyber safety & how to teach our children to be responsible digital citizens,” the first lady tweeted. The irony of her post did not go unnoticed, however. It was a very productive meeting on cyber safety & how to teach our children to be responsible digital citizens. Thank you @amazon @Facebook@FOSI @Google @m_Beckerman @Microsoft  @Twitter & @snap for coming to the @WhiteHouse today & sharing your valuable insight and expertise. pic.twitter.com/YY2srrbYhP Many tweeters called the first lady out for not first confronting her renowned cyberbully husband, President Donald Trump, over his online behavior. Here’s a sampling of the responses: Teach the man you live with Maybe you should start by teaching your bully of a husband @realDonaldTrump not to insult everyone he comes in contact with. How can you be an advocate for cyber bullying when the president is the biggest bully ever?...ESPECIALLY ON TWITTER! pic.twitter.com/bs512yZPwF Did you just show them slides of your husbands Tweets and say, "Don't do this"?#FollowMeForSnarkyShenanigans Shameful, disgraceful...start at home Melania. This is complete hypocrisy. You always tweet as though you've never met your husband. Shame on you. I notice you're not using the word cyber bullying because you know this is a travesty, Melania. Your husband is the king of bullying on social media!  Did he bully you to talk about this today?? pic.twitter.com/ZZlgFfogfj This is null and void if she doesn't publicly call @POTUS @realDonaldTrump out for bullying! @FLOTUS Come on Melania! Seriously? I understand you care about this but your husband is the biggest bully...please stop him, then you wld hv more credibility Might you begin this conversation with your husband- the biggest bully in USA? Good luck....with that...
