"Mission: Impossible ― Fallout" is due out this year, but there's at least one last shot to complete, according to the director. And it's a doozy. Director Christopher McQuarrie posted a photo on his Instagram Sunday, showing 55-year-old Tom Cruise poised at the backdoor of a cargo plane, ready to make a jump from 7,600m. A post shared by Christopher McQuarrie (@christophermcquarrie) on Mar 25, 2018 at 7:06am PDT McQuarrie said they crew had just three minutes of available light at dusk for a two-minute action shot, meaning they get one opportunity a day to get it right. It's unclear if this particular take was successful, or how many takes in total have been attempted. Cruise posted a similar photo on his Instagram two weeks ago, so it's safe to assume Cruise has made a few jumps.

Meanwhile, Cruise's stunt double has finished his 37th crossword puzzle while on set. We kid, but, seriously, that job has to be boring. "Mission: Impossible ― Fallout", the latest instalment in the increasingly inaccurately named franchise, comes out July 27.
