The world is remembering civil rights icon Linda Brown, who died on Monday at the age of 76. As a little girl, Brown was at the center of the historic Brown vs. Board of Education case, which ultimately ended segregation in U.S. public schools. Supermodel Naomi Campbell and movie director¬†Ava DuVernay were among the many who paid tribute to Brown on Twitter: Linda Brown's passing is a reminder that our youth have always been our future. Her courage at such a young age to stand up to segregated schools forever changed the fight for our civil rights. I am sending my condolences to the Brown family, along with our entire nation. pic.twitter.com/75Nt0Z6hLn #RestInPower Linda Brown.
