Velvet suits, metallic gowns and ethereal white dresses dominated the Oscars red carpet on Sunday night. Stars and their stylists stuck with the usual dress code of classic black-tie attire on film’s biggest night. Only a few people were bold enough to take risks (hello, Adam Rippon’s S&M-inspired tuxedo). But at the Academy Awards after-parties ― notably the famed Vanity Fair Oscars bash ― it’s an entirely different story. Celebrities only risk a fashion misstep if they don’t change into something more fun and a little more risqué. Kendall Jenner wore what looked like a dress with wings, Padma Lakshmi pulled off the toughest look of the night, and Emma Watson showed off her temporary “Time’s Up” tattoo (which unfortunately had a minor grammatical error). If you want to see a list of the best dressed, look no further than the cast of “Black Panther.” Check out all the gorgeous after-party looks below: Share this slide:
