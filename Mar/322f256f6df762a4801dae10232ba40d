Long-running music show, "Club 808" will air for the last time on March 30, following its cancellation by e.tv. Over seven years on air, the variety music show has had a number of different presenters. Current presenter Bontle Modiselle took to Twitter to confirm the cancellation, and to thank fans for their support. "It's been an absolute pleasure entertaining those who watched, and I'll do so for the remainder of [the] season, and hereafter," she said.  Reacting to the news, many felt the show had run its course, while others hoped the channel could save it.     Until March 30, the show airs every Friday at 4.25pm on e.tv.
