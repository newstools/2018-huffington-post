Tributes for famed theoretical physicist, cosmologist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking filled social media sites overnight. Hawking died on Wednesday at the age of 76. Scientists, media personalities, celebrities and many of the millions around the world who were influenced by his work and inspired by his life shared their thoughts: I rarely cry at the death of people I don't know personally, but the announcement of the passing of Stephen Hawking just brought tears to my eyes. What a beautiful genius this earth has lost. Thank you Stephen Hawking

A testament that disability is not "inability" and that people with disabilities can achieve anything they set their minds to. We were on earth at the same time as Stephen Hawking.

That's kind of a miraculous thing.

We breathed the same air as the man who demystified the stars. "We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special." If understanding the Universe makes us special, then Dr. Stephen Hawking was truly extraordinary. May he rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/aOn5DMGFjn Goodbye, Stephen Hawking ðŸ˜” pic.twitter.com/PWcRlAPLyN Share this slide:
