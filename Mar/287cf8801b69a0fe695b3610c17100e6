In what can only be described as civil war-like conditions, a police station was partially burnt in Hermanus and a tense standoff between police and "land-invaders" continues to escalate. The incident occurred on Monday, and massive damage was inflicted on private property.

According to TimesLive, Overberg police commander, Brigadier Donovan Heilbron confirmed that nobody had been injured in the fire.  EFF proportional representation councillor in Overstrand Benet Molefe told TimesLive that the EFF was "taken aback by the lack of action from the municipality and the provincial government".
