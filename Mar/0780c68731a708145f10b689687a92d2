From Nasty C to Ricky Rick, Loot Love to Emtee, and even style guru Maps Maponyane, the Legends Barbershop is becoming the go-to spot for celebrities looking for the ultimate cut and fade, and their latest styles take the humble "short, back and sides" to another level. The original Diepsloot barber â€” next to Zone 6, the nightclub owned by DJ Black Coffee â€” became known for it's "fade", which seamlessly transitions hair from a completely bare naked scalp, to a head full of hair in a smooth gradient. But now it does all sorts of undercuts, waves and patterns that you need to see to appreciate.  The team, which started as a small unit in Diepsloot but now has six branches nationwide and even boasts an innovative "mobile service" out of a roving hair van, post some extraordinary before-and-after shots on their social channels, which we can't stop scrolling through. #thelegendaryexperience #legendsbarbershop #TLB ðŸ“¸ : @alexscottlambley A post shared by  ðŸ’ˆLegends BarbershopðŸ’ˆ (@legends_barber) on Mar 17, 2018 at 12:09am PDT  Check out some of the cuts you'll see the cool kids rocking around South Africa this year: #legendaryhaircut #thelegendaryexperience #legendsbarbershop #TLB A post shared by  ðŸ’ˆLegends BarbershopðŸ’ˆ (@legends_barber) on Mar 9, 2018 at 11:13pm PST  Their patterns take patience, but look flawless. #legendaryhaircut #thelegendaryexperience #legendsbarbershop #throwback #TLB A post shared by  ðŸ’ˆLegends BarbershopðŸ’ˆ (@legends_barber) on Feb 12, 2018 at 9:08pm PST   #legendaryhaircut #thelegendaryexperience #legendsbarbershop #TLB A post shared by  ðŸ’ˆLegends BarbershopðŸ’ˆ (@legends_barber) on Feb 11, 2018 at 6:58am PST   We love the fade they did for Masechaba Ndlovu:  And Amanda Black:  Loot Love has always rocked short locks, but still:  And lastly, the ever-fresh Nasty C.
