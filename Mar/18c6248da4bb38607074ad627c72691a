“Narcos” is the most popular show on Netflix, at least according one widely shared 2017 analysis. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly which part of the show makes it so popular ― maybe it’s the cocaine or money or violence or, unexpectedly, all those DEA agents. Strangely, the show got even more popular with critics after that very important character “left the show” (no spoilers), so there are clearly several reasons “Narcos” has appeal. With that in mind, this list of recommendations for similar shows is a bit varied. Netflix hasn’t announced when Season 4 of “Narcos” will debut. But the first three seasons have all appeared at the end of summer, so you probably have quite a few months before the show returns. In the meantime, consider getting through this waiting period by checking out the shows featured below.
