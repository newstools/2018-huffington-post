There's no doubt how talented renowned actress/singer Marah Louw is, so her performance on drama series "The Queen" reminded many why they love her — and we're in the same boat. In the series, Louw portrays Boitshwarelo (Boi) Maake, the matriarch of her family and sister to Jerry (played by Shona Ferguson), a well liked officer of the law in Tembisa. A heartbroken Jerry vowed to never forgive his sister, after he found out that she [Boi] knew about a relationship between his new wife, Vuyiswa (played by Zandile Msutwana), and his son Bakang (played by Thato Molamu) – and didn't tell him. shuuuu this scene 😩😭😭😩👌👌👌👌 #TheQueenMzansi @thequeenmzansi pic.twitter.com/BpIDnlz4nb  Even the show's co-creator and producer, Connie Ferguson, was with us. She took to Twitter to stan for her husband in his scene with Louw. Watching @Shona_Ferguson cry like that on #TheQueenMzansi ripped my heart 2 shreds!😭😭😭 Funny how he's the one consoling me now telling me "baby it's just acting" like I don't know!😂 Now I'm crying & laughing at the same damn time!🙄😂😭 Bravo Mr. Sho!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️❤️❤️  What followed was a series of emotional scenes which left all us literally gobsmacked. When the truth is too ugly to handle. Tonight Boizen says the unthinkable to Bakang.
