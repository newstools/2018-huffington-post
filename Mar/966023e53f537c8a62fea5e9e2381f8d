South Africa has a new Guinness World Record. A team representing Clover brand Cream O'Naise broke the record for the world's longest line of sandwiches on Saturday, March 3 â€“ constructing a sarmie feast that measured a whopping 4,004.43 metres. Yes, that's more than 4 kilometres of sandwiches; the length of 40 soccer fields. New record: Longest line of sandwiches - 4,004.43 m (13,137 ft 10.40 in) - Congratulations to Clover SA - @CreamONaise in Johannesburg, South Africa ðŸ¥ªðŸ¥ªðŸ¥ªðŸŽ‰ pic.twitter.com/08YObcjiZK  Hundreds attended the record attempt at Maponya Mall in Soweto, to see the Cream O'Naise team challenge an official Guinness title held by the brand Nocilla of Spain, that set the mark at 3,865.78 metres in 2013. The record stunt used 500 litres of mayonnaise, 8,100 baguettes measuring 50 centimetres each, 2,600kg of grated cheese and 800kg of lettuce.
