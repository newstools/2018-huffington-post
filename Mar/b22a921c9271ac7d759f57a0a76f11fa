HuffPost's Yashar Ali previously reported in November that at least three of the women accusing actor Danny Masterson of rape are Scientologists. Despite evidence, sources told HuffPost that investigations into the matters stalled. Masterson is a longtime member of the church, which has been accused of covering up allegations of misconduct against the organisation and its members. Reports on the organization launching a media network have been around since 2016, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The Scientology Network will be available to audiences on Scientology.tv, Apple TV, DirecTV, Roku, fireTV, iTunes and Google Play.
