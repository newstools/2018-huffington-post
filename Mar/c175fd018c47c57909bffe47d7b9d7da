Those who enjoy dairy-free dessert treats will be welcoming the rise of vegan ice-creams in South Africa. These alternatives contain no gelatin, eggs, milk products, sugar or preservatives, and mainly rely on nut and plant-based "milk" as an alternative to dairy. And as it turns out, you don't have to look far to find these delectable treats. We narrowed down five of them, in-shop and online. 1. Yo Coco KZN-born Sinenhlanhla Ndlela founded the popular vegan ice-cream company in 2016. You can place orders online, with delivery in and around Johannesburg.
