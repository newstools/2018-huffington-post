Mountainous Nepal is notorious for air accidents. Small aircraft often run into trouble at provincial airstrips.   A Thai Airways flight from Bangkok crashed while trying to land in Kathmandu in 1992 killing all on board. US-Bangla Airlines is a unit of the US-Bangla Group, a U.S. Bangladeshi joint venture company. The Bangladeshi carrier launched operations in July 2014 and operates Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) and Boeing (BA.N) aircraft.
