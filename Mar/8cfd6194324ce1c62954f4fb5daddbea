The theme for this year's Saftas is #OurStoriesAreGold and the who's who of South African showbiz will gather at the Sun City Superbowl to celebrate the TV and Film industry's best. True to form, celebrities and invited guests will walk the red carpet in style rocking some of the latest fashion trends. In an interview with HuffPost recently, media personality and style expert Kat Sinivasan said owing to the wave of African fashion that followed the "Black Panther", the trend on the red carpet this year is likely to be African prints, Wakanda style. "I have a very strong feeling that the trend at the Saftas red carpet this year will be Wakanda. I think we will see a lot of Africanism -- prints and all. However, what I'd advise against is people going overboard. The last thing you need is to look like you're heading to a traditional wedding and you're the bride or groom. "We're Africans and traditional wear is what we do, but if an event, just like the Saftas, requires a black tie, all we do is tweak that and add our own Afro-chic style to that theme," he said.
