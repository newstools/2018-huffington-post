Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's love story is getting the Lifetime treatment in the upcoming film "Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance." The movie's first teaser trailer is here and it's schmaltzy, to say the least. Starring Parisa Fitz-Henley as Markle and Murray Fraser as Harry, the trailer offers a glimpse of the couple's engagement (over a roasted chicken), a trip to what looks like Botswana and, of course, a few cheesy lines of dialogue. "I don't need my life to be this perfect royal picture," Fraser tells the fake version of the "Suits" actress. "I just need you." A post shared by Parisa Fitz-Henley (@parisafitzhenley) on Mar 13, 2018 at 9:06am PDT The movie is set to premiere on Sunday, May 13, at 8 p.m. EST, just a few days before the couple's real royal nuptials take place on Saturday, May 19. If you'd like to get a head start on some royal romance, try watching Lifetime's 2011 movie based on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's romance, appropriately called "William and Kate."
