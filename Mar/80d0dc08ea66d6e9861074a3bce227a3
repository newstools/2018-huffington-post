Chinese social media users are abuzz after a camera caught a reporter’s candid moment at a government event. The footage captured reporter Liang Xiangyi ― who works for Yicai, China’s largest financial media conglomerate ― rolling her eyes as another reporter, Zhang Huijun, asks a question during a convening of the National People’s Congress. While these press conferences are typically heavily scripted and choreographed, often peppered with questions meant to spotlight the government’s achievements, the eyeroll wasn’t.

Social media users even came out with GIFs and parodies of the moment: Amazing to see how these two ladies  just exploded over Chinese social media in the span of a few hours.

Her question was directed at government official Xiao Yaqing, and partly involved what his plans were for 2018 and what he would do to protect Chinese state-owned enterprises. Netizens said the question was so long that it resembled a speech and likely prompted Liang’s eyeroll. The Communist Party quickly made moves to censor Liang’s name on social media, and rumors have been swirling that she has been suspended from her position. However, Liang’s employment status has not been confirmed, and Yicai hasn’t released a statement on the incident.
