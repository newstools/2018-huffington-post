A "pitch invasion" resulted in the Varsity Cup match between the Madibaz and Maties being called off in Port Elizabeth on Monday. Eight minutes into the second half, the game was stopped after unrest broke out at the Nelson Mandela University's south campus. According to Netwerk24, disorder began when students from the student representative council tried to force their way into the university's box. Fights broke out when students reportedly stormed the stairs and attempted to kick open the door, and security guards stepped in.
