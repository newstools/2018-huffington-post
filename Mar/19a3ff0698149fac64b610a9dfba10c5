President Donald Trump endures a cartoon nightmare in a new short from “The Simpsons.” Trump takes a hard look in the mirror in the amusing “A Tale Of Two Trumps” clip that Fox shared online Friday. “You’ve been acting like a narcissistic sociopath and 64 percent to 67 percent of the people hate you,” Trump tells himself, as he finally appears to find the benefits of being brutally honest.  But there’s a twist in the tale, and it’s not long before a familiar figure is facing Trump’s fury once more. Check out the full clip above.
