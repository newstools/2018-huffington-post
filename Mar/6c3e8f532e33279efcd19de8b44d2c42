Zimbabwean villagers who were evicted from Manzou farm in Mazowe in 2015 to pave way for the then first lady Grace Mugabe have reportedly been awarded more than $30 000 as compensation by the court. The villagers were evicted in spite of a court order granting them reprieve to stay on the farm until government secured alternative land for them. During the forced evictions, police destroyed homesteads, household furniture and the villagers' crops, including maize grain and groundnuts, reports said. Through their human rights lawyer, Noble Chinhau, the villagers led by Leonard Mukoore, demanded compensation for loss of property and dignity they suffered. In court papers filed at the Bindura magistrates court, the families accused the police of evicting them without a court order.
