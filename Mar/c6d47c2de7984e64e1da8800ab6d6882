Oprah Winfrey isn’t playing President Donald Trump’s insult game. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly attacked the actress and talk show maven. He called Winfrey “very insecure” in a tweet last month and over the weekend he promised to make a possible presidential run “painful” for her. “I would love to beat Oprah,” Trump said during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night. “I know her weakness.” Not surprisingly, Winfrey took the high road on Sunday when CNN’s Van Jones asked what she would say in response to Trump’s comments. “I wouldn’t,” Winfrey replied. “I would only speak if I felt that I could be heard.” "I would only speak if I felt that I could be heard," @Oprah tells @VanJones68 after he asks her what she would say if she had 10 minutes with President Trump #VanJonesShow https://t.co/N7u4pDAaqc pic.twitter.com/tfOrAS9B9F Winfrey’s powerful speech at the Golden Globe Awards earlier this year drew both acclaim and calls for her to run for president against Trump in 2020.  However, she has since said she hasn’t heard from God on the issue. “(I)f God actually wanted me to run, wouldn’t God kind of tell me?” Winfrey said on “60 Minutes Overtime.” “And I haven’t heard that.” While not a candidate herself, Winfrey did offer some advice for whoever does run: “I will say to whoever is going to run for office, do not give your energy to the other side. Do not spend all your time talking about your opponents. Do not give your energy to that which you really don’t believe in. Do not spend an ounce of your time on that.” Share this slide:
