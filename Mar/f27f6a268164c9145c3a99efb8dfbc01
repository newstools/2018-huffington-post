Supermodel Chrissy Teigen has the answer to most of life's questions ― including, maybe, the one currently burning up the internet. In a GQ story published on Monday, actress Tiffany Haddish spilled the beans about an unidentified actress allegedly biting Beyoncé in the face at a party in December. Teigen, naturally, became determined to discover the person's identity. "Beyoncé's at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, 'Did she really bite you?'" Haddish told GQ. "She was like, 'Yeah.' I was like, 'She gonna get her ass beat tonight.' She was like, 'Tiffany, no. Don't do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.'" On Monday morning, Teigen declared on Twitter that finding out the truth was of the utmost importance to her. She wasn't alone: Fans got the hashtag #WhoBitBeyonce trending on social media. However, it seems Teigen ― who does pal around with Bey when she's not bowing down to her ― was way off with her original guess. Teigen said on Monday afternoon that someone had tipped her off to the biter's real identity, and it was not who she thought. But Teigen refused to give the goods to inquiring minds. "I AM NEVER TELLING," she tweeted. "I'm scared I've said too much. KNOWLEDGE IS A CURSE!" Of course, by that point the Beyhive had already been activated. The "Lemonade" singer's followers have been on a mission since Monday to determine who bit their queen. Sanaa Lathan and Sara Foster, two actresses who were at the December party in question, have denied any wrongdoing.
