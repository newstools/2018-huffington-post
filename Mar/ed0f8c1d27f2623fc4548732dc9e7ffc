The University of Cape Town's Zamani Project, an extraordinary initiative combining the latest technology with heritage preservation, is travelling across Africa capturing some of the continent's most extraordinary architectural structures. Their latest project will see the group, lead by UCT emeritus professor of geomatics Heinz Rüther, document the intervention and upgrading of the historic Stone Town seafront in Zanzibar using stereo photogrammetry and highly detailed 3D models based on laser scanning. But it's just the latest project for the extraordinary heritage group. Check out some of their 3D models below, to be transported around Africa in virtual reality.
