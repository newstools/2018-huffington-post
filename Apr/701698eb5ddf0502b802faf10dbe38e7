For many proud owners, a pet isn’t just an animal, but a fully-fledged member of the family. They keep us active, are great companions and improve our physical and mental health. We don’t need an excuse to celebrate our little (or in some cases, rather large) bundles of joy, but as it’s National Pet Day, we won’t pass up the opportunity either. To mark the day, people on Twitter have been sharing fun and adorable snaps of their furry friends (plus a not-so-furry tortoise), using the hashtag #NationalPetDay. Here are a few of our favourites guaranteed to brighten your day.
