Bonang Matheba has confirmed that her reality show, "Being Bonang" is making a comeback to a TV near you on May 4. She told HuffPost that the show will lift the lid on her day-to-day life, and will not be so different from season one. "It's still funny. Pinky girl and all my favourite people are still there including my family and friends. I'm a very private person and I hardly share anything that's happening in my life, so this reality show is my way to do that. It's fun, light-hearted and just about family as well. "I'm going to show people into my space. A lot of people are wondering how I'm doing after the breakup, and you will see that in the show too," she said.
