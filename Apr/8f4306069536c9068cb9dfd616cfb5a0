ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe has apologised to the people of Brandfort because plans to turn the home of struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela into a museum have still not materialised. "The fact that it has not been erected up to now is a mistake. I apologise. We are owing the people of Brandfort a museum here," Mantashe, who is also Minister of Mineral Resources, said. He was speaking at the memorial service held for Madikizela-Mandela in Brandfort on Monday afternoon.

The Department of Arts and Culture allocated funds to the project 10 years ago, but there has still been no progress. Madikizela-Mandela lived in the dilapidated three-bedroom house when she was banished to the Free State town in 1977.

"That house has a historic place in South Africa, therefore it must be restored as a heritage site. There must be a monument there. That commitment can't be limited to the province." -- News24
