Property mogul Pam Golding passed away on Tuesday at the age of 90. She was the founder of Pam Golding Property Group. Golding died peacefully at her home in Wittebomen in Constantia, Cape Town, according to a statement from the Golding family. She began her property empire in 1976, at a time when the real estate industry was described as "male-dominated". "She quickly identified a niche in the market for a discreet and professional property agency in South Africa, in the process building a reputation for selling the country's most luxurious homes and building integrity, trust and respect of the Pam Golding Properties brand," says the statement. Golding then opened up an office in London in 1986 and eventually expanded the business further abroad with her son and chief executive Dr Andrew Golding. The South African Estate Agency Affairs Board says the passing of South African property mogul and leading businesswoman, Pam Golding has left a void in the property market.
