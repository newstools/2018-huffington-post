  The Karlmann King is an SUV designed in China and assembled almost completely by hand in Europe, with a chassis and engine supplied by Ford. It's also the most expensive SUV in the world, with a price tag of $3.8 million (46 million), according to the company's press release. The King blew some minds at the Dubai International Motor Show in November. Inspired by stealth fighter jets like the F-117 Nighthawk, the Karlmann King has a hulking, polygonal body frame, which pushes the SUV's weight to nearly 10,000 pounds (4535 kg), and a matte finish. But while the company views the outside as a beast, it thinks of the inside as a jewel. It features a 40-inch television, Playstation, internet, refrigerator, bar, integrated laptops, satellite navigation system, coffee machine and a rainbow of mood lighting. And for nearly $4 million(49 million), we would sure hope to have a coffee machine included. The standard cost is $3.8 million (46 million), but the Karlmann King's price is negotiated with each owner due to the customization options available, the company said. Check out some more photos of this monster below. The company says it's making only nine of these goliaths, meaning most of us will never own one, drive one, or even see one in action. So here's a video of the Karlmann King cutting around the desert.
