Chaos erupted after Kaizer Chief's 2-0 Nedbank Cup semi-final loss to Free State Stars on Saturday night â€” resulting in an unconscious security guard. Fans in Durban stormed the Moses Mabhida Stadium pitch and can be seen on video repeatedly kicking and beating the guard with unidentifiable and identifiable objects such as chairs, before fleeing as police approached. Disclaimer: According to some reports, the security guard is a male. The sex of the security guard is not yet confirmed. Shocking! ðŸ’” Female security guard attacked during violent stadium invasion at the Moses Mabhida stadium, Durban.

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Let's find them, call them out and report them! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨#NedbankCup semi-final, Kaizer Chiefs vs Free State Stars.

ðŸ“½ via @thomasmlambopic.twitter.com/tRR3Q40esm   This is disappointing ðŸ˜”#NedbankCup pic.twitter.com/FtL9E4gyzP   Irate fans and South Africans more broadly have expressed their utter disappointment with the behaviour of Amakhosi fans on social media, especially towards this particular security guard. What kind of disgusting human being kicks a defenseless woman down on the ground in the face until she loses consciousness??? We need arrests here, not just sanctions forcing the club to play behind closed doors. More must be done. #nedbankcup  Yesterday a defenseless lady was beaten to within an inch of her life because a football result wasn't to fans liking. We are now at the stage where human life means less than a score-line. What a shameful day! #NedbankCup   They, as we do, are itching to know what the course of action will be to obtain justice for the guard. Some have expressed their suggestions. Kaizer Chiefs fans should be held responsible and arrested for what they did yesterday. We cannot allow them to get away with what they did. I'm disappointed in their conduct. #NedbankCup #Khosi4Life pic.twitter.com/vTc1kfayz9  Kaizer Chiefs games must be played in a "still cage pitch" akere they have WWE superstars Supporters.. #NedbankCup @KaizerChiefs pic.twitter.com/xDF4tzjbWp  KaizerChiefs must pay her . Compensate her very well. This is just nonsense as a KC fan this a pure disgrace. This is just bull... dazmmmnnn the poor woman though.. she didnt do anything that contributed to the lose.  If police didn't or don't make arrest with evidence we all see and is freely available, holiganism won't stop in our stadiums   The security guard was severely hurt, and is in hospital, reported Times Live. Some spectators were also injured, four fires were reportedly started at the stadium and camera crew equipment was destroyed. #NedbankCup The moment players ran for their lives.
