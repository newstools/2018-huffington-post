John Oliver says EPA chief Scott Pruitt's big spending on security might be needed after all. Some of Pruitt's much criticised $832,000 (~R10-million) security tab for the first quarter included protection during a trip to Disneyland. On Sunday's broadcast of "Last Week Tonight", Oliver said that the expense could actually be legit. "If anyone needs security at Disneyland, it's Scott Pruitt â€• a man who even Mickey and Minnie Mouse would tell to go f*ck himself," Oliver said. "Space Mountain's going to be underwater in 10 years, you son of a b*tch!" Share this slide:
