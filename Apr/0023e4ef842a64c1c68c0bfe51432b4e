Game of Phones: Every week I'll pick a new game for iOS or Android that's perfect for long journeys, the commute or when you just want to switch off from the outside world. Who would have thought it, one of the calmest commutes I've ever had was while playing a game on my phone about... commuting. Mini Metro is a subway simulator that challenges you to create your own version of the New York Subway or London Underground. This is not some snore-fest of numbers and employee management meetings — instead, you simply use your finger to drag and draw brand new lines on which trains then carry the city's commuters. And what beautiful lines they are. Each map has been lovingly recreated using a particular city's metro system and the minimalist interface is gloriously intuitive. Be warned though, as you increase the size of your subway, so too will the number of commuters increase — and with great responsibility comes slightly increased pressure. The game never moves into the realm of actually being stressful, choosing instead to gently hover around being quite challenging. Once you get the hang of it though, it quickly becomes a mindless and addictive escape from the noise and bustle around you. Download it immediately but don't blame me when you miss your stop. Mini Metro is available to download on iOS and Android.
