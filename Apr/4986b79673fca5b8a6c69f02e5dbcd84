The EFF has won a by-election in North West's Ditsobotla municipality, taking a seat from the ANC. The Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) on Thursday released results of seven by-elections held on Wednesday in three provinces – namely Gauteng, North West and Western Cape. The DA retained the five seats they won in the 2016 local government elections — three in Gauteng and two in Western Cape. The ANC also retained one seat in the Ward 92 by-election in Johannesburg. The EFF's Bongani Patrick Cekiso, meanwhile, claimed victory in Ward 15 in Ditsobotla, taking the seat from the ANC. "The party won the seat from the ANC, with 36.48 percent of the votes cast, compared to 54.79 percent that the ANC received in the 2016 municipal elections. Voter turnout yesterday was 48.67 percent," the IEC said on its website on Thursday. The EFF in North West saluted its "ground forces" following the victory, praising them for a "militant campaign". "We salute the Ward 15 branch command team, our tireless volunteers, provincial elections team, our public representatives and all ground forces for their efforts and commitments for making it possible. "This is a signal that the EFF is a beacon of hope to the hopeless masses of our people in North West," said EFF North West spokesperson Baruti Daniel Sephelle in a statement. The party also thanked voters for rejecting the ANC amid mass protests over more alleged Gupta scandals involving premier Supra Mahumapelo. "Our people rejected them even after they've slaughtered three cows, printed T-shirts and gave them food parcels, which were intent on buying their votes, but [they] chose superior logic," the statement said. It further called on the ANC to stop denying the "democratic choice" of the people. The other six results are as follows: DA councillors: ANC councillor: — News24
