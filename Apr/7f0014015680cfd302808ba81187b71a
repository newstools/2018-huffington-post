A South Korean court found former president Park Geun-hye guilty of bribery on Friday in a scandal that exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and the country's conglomerates. The court ruled that Park colluded with her old friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates such as Samsung and Lotte to help Choi's family and fund non-profit foundations owned by her. Park, 66, has denied wrongdoing and was not present in court. Prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence and a 118.5-billion won ($112-million) fine for Park, after indicting her on charges that included bribery, abuse of power and coercion.
