Renowned SABC newscaster Noxolo Grootboom is back on air to anchor the public broadcaster's news coverage of the 10-day mourning period and official funeral service of struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Grootboom, who stepped down as a newsreader to take up a news editor position behind the scenes, sealed her place in the hearts of many and is known for her famous closing line, "Ndinithanda nonke emakhaya" – loosely translated, "I love you all at home."  Her return to in front of the camera follows a social media request from 94.7 Highveld Stereo's news anchor, Thembekile Mrototo, for the public broadcaster to bring her back for the period leading up to the funeral. I need Mam'Noxolo Grootboom to come back on air for Mam'Winnie's funeral. That's all I ask.  Although his request seemed like a long shot, his wish was granted, much to the delight of all Mam'Noxolo's fans. We've been granted our wish!
