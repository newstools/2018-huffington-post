Who’s your daddy? That’s what Trevor Noah wants to know after a rumor of a Donald Trump love child emerged Thursday. “I’ll bet everyone who doesn’t know their father right now is panicking,” “The Daily Show” host cracked. Outlets investigated a claim that the National Enquirer’s publishing company paid off a doorman in Trump Tower to keep quiet about a child Trump supposedly fathered with a housekeeper. Several former employees of the publisher anonymously told The New Yorker that the tabloid’s reporters followed up on the story, and said the doorman passed a lie-detector test. The New Yorker, however, found no evidence of a Trump love child, and the Trump Organization denied the allegation. Still, the report made for excellent comic fodder. Watch the whole bit above to discover why Trump’s “dong has its own economy.”
