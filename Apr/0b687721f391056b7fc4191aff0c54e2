Whether it's bidding on a $19,000 [~R229,000] piece of art, telling her parents to quiet down at an awards show or wearing the kid's version of a $26,000 [~R313,000] Gucci gown, virtually anything Blue Ivy Carter does is guaranteed to make headlines. The eldest daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z was back in the news last wee, when Women's Wear Daily reported (and confirmed with a rep for Bey) that the six-year-old actually has her own personal stylist and shopper. WWD identified the personal shopper/stylist as Manuel A Mendez, a longtime employee of Beyoncé's company Parkwood Entertainment. On Instagram, Mendez lists himself as a personal assistant at the company. He reportedly began working with Blue when she was just 20 months old, according to People magazine. Mendez regularly posts photos on Instagram of the looks he's styled for Blue. A post shared by Manuel A. Mendez (@mmanuelamendez) on Dec 29, 2017 at 8:56pm PST A post shared by Manuel A.
