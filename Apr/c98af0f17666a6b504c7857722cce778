South African wrestler Martin Erasmus powered his way to gold against Mausam Khatri of India in the Men's Freestyle 97kg on day nine of the Commonwealth Games [CWG] on Friday. The win meant SA has a total of 12 gold medals – however, New Zealand is right behind us in the race to finish fifth on the overall standings.  Team SA also won silver in the dramatic climax of the Women's Bowls Pairs final, where SA duo Nicolene Neal and Colleen Piketh just missed out on the gold in a titanic battle with Malaysia.   If Team SA had taken the gold, SA would've leapfrogged Canada into fourth place on the medals table – but Mzansi had to settle for silver. However, to date Team SA has won a total of 35 medals, with 1,500m champ Caster Semenya still set to compete in the 800m final at 12.45pm SA time.  Semenya has a chance to become the first female athlete to win a gold in the 1,500m and the 800m, and she's competing in the race that has long been her speciality.   She's not the only formidable woman in action – the Springboks Sevens Women's team have yet to play two matches at the first CWG to include the discipline. Stephen Mokoka is also in action – South African fans will be hoping to see him take gold in the Men's 10,000m final.
