Meghan Markle may not be an official member of the royal family yet, but her wardrobe is definitely fit for a duchess. Since her engagement to Prince Harry at the end of 2017, the 36-year-old has embraced the hallmarks of royal style, such as fascinators, well-tailored coats and classically feminine silhouettes. (Perhaps she’s even taken some style tips from the Duchess of Cambridge. Maybe one day they’ll even share clothes.) The former “Suits” star has also shown us she’s not afraid to break convention every once in a while. Remember the sleek pantsuit she wore for her first royal evening outing? On May 19, Markle will marry Prince Harry in what will surely be the wedding event of the year. If her style choices between November and now are any indication, the former actress will fit right in with the Windsors. Take a look for yourself: Share this slide:
