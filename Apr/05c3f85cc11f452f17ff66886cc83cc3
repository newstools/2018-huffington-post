Taylor Swift surprised about 40 lucky patrons at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe Saturday night when she walked out on stage to perform at the venue where she was discovered over a decade ago. Audiences were there to spend an evening with legendary country songwriter Craig Wiseman, who welcomed Swift on stage for a few songs. The pop star began performing at Bluebird Cafe after she moved to Nashville, eventually getting discovered there when she was in the eighth grade. According to the Tennessean, Swift's surprise appearance was being filmed for an upcoming documentary on the storied Nashville venue, which is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. The star thanked the venue for providing a space where songwriters can perform their work. "I think any songwriter in town would echo my sentiments and say that this is kind of the only place where this exists â€• this particular place where you get to come and hear the writer's take on the songs they've put out into the world," Swift said, according to the Tennessean. Before closing out her set, Swift and Wiseman did a shot of Fireball whiskey together as they reminisced about the pop star's early days in her career. A fan page dedicated to Swift shared an image of the star performing in 2004, alongside one from Saturday night. Share this slide:
