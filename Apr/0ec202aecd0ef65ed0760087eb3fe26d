Our hair, glorious as it may be, can be prone to dryness or brittleness, especially in the harsh winter weather. It's for this reason hairstylists strongly recommend protective hairstyles during seasons like winter— to keep your hair from being exposed to harsh elements. Plus, a protective hairstyle can literally give you a break from the daily – and sometimes laborious – maintenance of hair. If social media is anything to go by, these are the top protective hairstyles you can look forward to this winter in South Africa:  They are in and oh-so-pretty.

Buy one that fits your fancy — there are so many styles to choose from, and you'll be good to go.
