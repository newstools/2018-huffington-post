Renowned rapper HHP recently bid farewell to his best friend, Puleng, the dog that kept him company through his darkest days, according to him. The "Music and Lights" hitmaker took to Instagram on Thursday to share a heartwarming tribute to Puleng. In his caption, HHP thanked the SPCA for saving his other dog. He also explained the reason behind Puleng's name. "I called my dog Puleng because when I got him my son's mom had just left me. I was in a storm. Ke ne kele mo Puleng. Today you've cleared the dark clouds. I love you Puleng," he wrote.
