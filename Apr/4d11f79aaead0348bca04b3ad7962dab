Johannesburg has become notorious for rental scams, with fake landlords disappearing with thousands of rands conned from desperate rental seekers. "Time is a factor. Tenants are often eager to find the right home within a limited time frame, which can make them vulnerable targets for criminals," said Adrian Goslett, regional director and CEO of property group Remax.   Some scams are very easy to spot. Yet of late, they have become so sophisticated and appear so legit, that you'd be forgiven for falling victim. This is how the most promising rental opportunity can look:     While no precautionary step in the search of rental space is absolutely foolproof, there are steps you can take to lower your chances of being scammed: This might seem like a lot of work, but you can never be too careful. "Unfortunately there is no foolproof way to avoid a rental scam completely," added Goslett. "However, potential tenants will be far more protected if they pay attention to the warning signs. It is vital for tenants to deal with rental agents from a reputable agency that they know and trust."
