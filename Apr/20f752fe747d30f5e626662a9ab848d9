"25 'Weird' Things People Do Because of Anxiety" was written by Juliette Virzi for The Mighty. When you've lived with anxiety for a while, oftentimes you become aware of some of the unique things you do because of it â€” or even the "weird" ways you've learned to cope with it. Maybe you're like me and you check your pulse obsessively, willing your heart rate to just slow down. Maybe your anxiety makes you feel out of control, and it comes out as anger. Or maybe you've found a secret way of making yourself feel less anxious that you worry is "too weird" to share with others. No matter what unique or "weird" way your anxiety manifests, we want you to know you aren't alone. The only way we can break the shame and stigma surrounding "weird" things people do because of anxiety is to talk about it. To open up this discussion, we asked our Mighty community to share one "weird" thing they do because of anxiety. Before we begin, we want to preface by saying that feelings of embarrassment are very real, and like all feelings, are completely valid. But even though it's natural to feel like the things you do because of anxiety are "weird," we want you to know it's more than OK not to be OK and there is no shame in struggling with anxiety. Here's what our community shared with us. More from The Mighty: Can you relate?
