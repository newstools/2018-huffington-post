He was caught on camera by his boss, who later confronted him. It was during this conversation that things became violent. "He became angry and simply grabbed the kettle with boiling water and threw it on me and I got seriously burned. There other of my colleagues who were also burned, but I got serious burns because I was close." HuffPost tried to contact Rodizio Brazilian Restaurant and was told that the "bosses were in a meeting and no response was to be issued today". According to the employee who answered the phone on behalf of the company a response could only be expected on Friday and that no official comment was available.
