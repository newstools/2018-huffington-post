"Black Panther" has officially sailed passed "Titanic" to become third in the rankings for the top-grossing film of all time in the U.S. The Marvel blockbuster overtook James Cameron's 1997 smash hit on Saturday when it surpassed $665-million (over R8-billion) at the domestic box office. It's now the highest-grossing title at the North American box office after 2015′s "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" with $936.7-million (over R11-billion), and 2009′s "Avatar" with $760.5-million (over R9-billion). These figures haven't been adjusted for inflation. Doing that would mean "Gone With The Wind" is the highest-grossing film of all time. But we digress. "Black Panther" has grossed $1.29-billion (over R12-billion) worldwide since its release, and people can't stop showing love for the film. Once news broke that "Panther" had passed "Titanic" at the box office, the praise and snark came rolling in: Visual representation of Black Panther passing the Titanic in the U.S. box office. pic.twitter.com/R927oIeibZ Long live Wakanda.
