By the time the latest episode of Mzansi Magic's dating reality show, "Date My Family" finished airing, Sunday night Twitter was quite unsure whether to laugh or cry. The week's bachelor, Moremogolo, was out looking for love in Limpopo â€“ meeting the families of three potential dates over dinner. Thanks to his mannerism and use of language, the episode soon made the trending columns. Here are some of the moments from the night's episode: If you ever needed another way to explain what you do for a living.. When you're unemployed and gets asked what you do for a living. ðŸ¤£ #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/Cf86q8ijo8  Watch: #DateMyFamily: Dramatic scene 2: This week's bachelor has no job? pic.twitter.com/JurUziiHp9  Unfaithful men = decentralised branches?

We try very hard to keep our gregarious animals locked up at the game reserves but last nite one managed to jump the fence. We take is as a learning experience so as to avoid it in the future #datemyfamily  #datemyfamily Today i'm going to Moletjie, i just want to have a man to man with Moremogolo, just to talk. pic.twitter.com/3Jr213LfkR  On behalf of people from limpopo.
