Some of the negative responses on social media to the death of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela show that many people worldwide – and some white South Africans in particular – still consider her "the killer of Stompie Seipei" in January 1989. Which demonstrates just how effective the apartheid propaganda machine was – as the video below makes clear.  In a 2016 exclusive interview with HuffPost SA, Madikizela-Mandela sat down with filmmaker Pascal Lamche as they discussed the process of making the film "Winnie". Madikizela-Mandela had been convicted of kidnapping Seipei. She appealed a six-year sentence for the crime, which was reduced to a fine and two-year suspended sentence. She denied – even during an exclusive interview with HuffPost SA – that she was involved in his death. During her research for the documentary "Winnie", Pascal Lamche discovered information about Seipei's murder that she revealed to Madikizela-Mandela for the first time during our interview, which the struggle stalwart called "crucial".  Note: This story has been altered post-publication to correct an erroneous interpretation of the video that suggested Madikizela-Mandela was framed for Seipei's murder. HuffPost apologises for the error.
