Sometime before Donald Trump picked "dandruff" off Emmanuel Macron's shoulder and engaged in a bizarre handshake/cheek kiss moment with the French president on Tuesday, Trump tried to hold his wife Melania's hand.

Though the president and first lady seemed slow on the hand-holding uptake while welcoming Macron and his wife, Brigitte, on Tuesday, the Trumps were in fact photographed multiple times holding hands during the French leader's visit.
