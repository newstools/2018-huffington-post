President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to look into allegations of corruption at Eskom and Transnet following the losses suffered by the companies. According to Sunday Times, the authorising of the investigations was published in Friday's Government Gazette. The investigation will once again put the spotlight on two former Eskom executives -- former head of generation Matshela Koko and former chief financial officer Anoj Singh.   The issues to be investigated include:   The essence of the probe will determine whether any unauthorised and wasteful expenditure arose from the administration of the projects and whether service providers actually performed or performed defectively.
