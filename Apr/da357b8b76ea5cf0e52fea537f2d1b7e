Suspense thriller "Acrimony" opened in South African cinemas on March 29 and has proven a hit with audiences — especially in South Africa. The film's writer and director, Tyler Perry, took to Twitter to thank Mzansi for the support. "I see you South Africa!! You set a box-office record for 'Acrimony' a few weeks ago. Now we're still holding strong! I've got to plan a trip to say thank you!" he said on Twitter. South Africans were quite excited about the idea of having the Hollywood star visiting.    Perry is best-known for the Madea comedy franchise (starting with the hit "Diary Of A Mad Black Woman") — a franchise which he wrote and starred in, playing intimidating granny Madea in drag. He has produced and directed several other popular films.
