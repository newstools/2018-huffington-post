  Is a birthday without a cake really a birthday at all? Sure, we've had happy birthdays that were celebrated with lemon meringue pie and brownie sundaes. But even if you're not a cake person, nothing says "I love you," or "I love you but I'm afraid to tell you because I fear rejection," or maybe just "I can tolerate sitting next to you at work pretty well, at least on most days" better than a cake. Making a layer cake does take a little effort â€• there are multiple layers to be baked, each of which needs proper cooling before stacking it up and icing it without it toppling over. We've got 50 of those gorgeous doozies for you below. If you're a little less ambitious or less coordinated, go with a sheet cake. Most of them just require a quick bake in the oven, some time cooling on the counter and an easy dollop of icing on top. We've got 25 of those recipes for you below. Now go forth and bake with courage. You're about to make someone's day. Share this slide:
