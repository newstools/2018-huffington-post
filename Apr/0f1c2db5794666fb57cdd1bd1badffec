Caster Semenya's reign as the queen of middle-distance running may come to an end this year, following a new hyperandrogenism rule that could stop the Olympic and World 800m champion from running the race in future. The International Association of Athletics Federations [IAAF] approved the proposal, which was first raised in March, to set a limit on the permissible naturally produced testosterone in female competitors running 400m, 800m and 1,500m races. Social-media users have come out guns blazing in support of their golden girl:      The rule will force Semenya either to take testosterone-lowering medication to reduce her naturally occurring testosterone levels, or switch to longer-distance events. It will come into effect from November 1, 2018. Just let #CasterSemenya be. Sports/athletics transcends competition.
