The White House is yet again facing fierce criticism over the lack of diversity of the participants in its intern programme. A photograph released on Friday shows U.S. president Donald Trump posing with the spring intake, who are overwhelmingly white: "The White House intern photo is like a Where's Waldo for a non-white person â€” in a country that is about 40 percent non-white," tweeted political scientist and Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas. "Diversity this ain't," added France 24 correspondent Philip Crowther. Other tweeters shared similarly biting comments: The Spring 2018 White House Interns!

House speaker Paul Ryan came under fire in July 2016 over this selfie with Capitol Hill interns, who were also almost exclusively white: A post shared by Speaker Paul Ryan (@speakerryan) on Jul 16, 2016 at 11:12am PDT
