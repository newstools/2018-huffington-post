  BeyoncÃ© took the stage again at Coachella in Indio, California, over the weekend â€• and this time she hit the floor. In a redux of the sibling dance-off from her epic set the previous weekend, the superstar singer appeared to accidentally drop younger sister Solange, and then she fell, too. Another fave moment was when Bey tried to pick up Solange and they fell lol pic.twitter.com/VWhkJqHXqS There were no apparent injuries, but lots of laughter as they kicked up their feet for a few moments. "Give it up for my sister!" BeyoncÃ© said. The funny moment happened Saturday, and the Beyhive was still buzzing about it on Monday: lol @ beyonce "i don't want ppl posting unflattering pics" and then she falls over on stage for the whole damn world to see ðŸ˜‚ #karma#Coachella All of BeyoncÃ¨ falls aren't even real falls like... how?? pic.twitter.com/2le2n5K3Ay Queen Bey even falls and it looks good! ðŸ’¯ https://t.co/EgBxEYVmsJ BeyoncÃ© is the queen of recovering from falls ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Reason #1638506037262 why BeyoncÃ© is the artist of my life: she falls and laughs at herself. #ClumsyIsCoolhttps://t.co/uNICyH2fVu
