Each year, the International Association of Professionals Birth Photographers hosts its Image of the Year Competition to honour the work of photographers who capture labour and delivery around the world. The photos submitted to the contest highlight the beauty, intimacy and ― yes ― messiness of birth. Below are the winners and honourable mentions of the 2018 competition ― a collection of stunning photos that showcase the raw power of these moments.
