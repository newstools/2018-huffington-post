The newest trailer for "Solo: A Star Wars Story" dropped on Sunday, and it takes a line used throughout the franchise and turns it completely around. "I've got a really good feeling about this," Han Solo says. The trailer also features a nod to Chewbacca's age (he's 190 at the time of this film), shots of a much newer Millennium Falcon in action, and a suave Lando Calrissian declaring, "Everything you've heard about me is true." "Solo: A Star Wars Story" stars Alden Ehrenreich as Solo, Donald Glover as Lando, and also features Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson and Thandie Newton. The film hits screens on May 25.
