Students around the country walked out of class on Friday to bring attention to gun violence in the U.S. The walkout also marked the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado. Photos from around the country show students protesting peacefully and making their voices heard,Â as well as protesting silently outside the White House.
