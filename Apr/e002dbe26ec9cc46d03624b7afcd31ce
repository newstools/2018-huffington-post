South Africans have once again proven that even in the darkest hour, they can find a way to laugh through any pain. EFF leader Julius Malema gave a fiery speech at the funeral service of struggle icon, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. In his address, he spoke directly to Madikizela-Mandela whom he had a close relationship with. He lambasted people he called sell-outs who did not support her when she was alive but are speaking out during her funeral supporting her. Watch the section of the speech here:  Taking to Twitter, people related their own situations and asked uMama Winnie to give them a signal on how to deal with them.     But South Africa?
