Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's Numerous Deaths Came With Numerous Lives The life of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela speaks of the damage of apartheid. Damage so extensive that it cannot be fully captured – not even by the phrase "crime against humanity", writes sociopolitical analyst Christi van der Westhuizen. 2. Ramaphosa Needs To Move On The NPA In delivering the state of the nation Address in February this year, President Ramaphosa said, "We will urgently attend to the leadership issues at the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that this critical institution is stabilised and able to perform its mandate unhindered."
