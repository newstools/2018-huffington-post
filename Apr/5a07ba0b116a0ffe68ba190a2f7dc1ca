Justin Bieber has insisted he has no regrets over his extensive body art, after revealing the full extent of his tattoo collection. While The Biebs' love of the ink has been no secret for many years now, recent paparazzi shots have proved that he's taken things up a notch lately. A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Mar 8, 2018 at 10:47pm PST Sharing a shirtless photo on his Instagram to show off his newest tattoos in full, Justin said that he is proud to have turned his body into "a canvas". He wrote: "If [tattoos] didn't hurt, everyone would have them. Well, maybe not everyone!!"

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ART AND I'VE MAde my body a canvas and it's SO MUCH FUN [sic]." While the "Love Yourself" singer has taken time out from the spotlight lately, he's also been noticeably quieter on social media. However, in recent weeks he's become much more vocal, particularly on Instagram, sharing a number of posts over Easter of him in various poses, sporting Easter Bunny sunglasses. He also posted a more religious message about the celebration, writing (in an all-caps message): "Jesus has changed my life. Easter is not about a bunny, it's a reminder that my Jesus died on the cross for my sins and then rose from the dead defeating death! I believe this happened and it changes everything!"
