President Donald Trump was met with silence at a campaign-style rally in Michigan Saturday night when he asked if there were any Hispanics present, then repeated his demand for a border wall. Trump skipped the White House Correspondents Dinner to instead regale his fervent supporters in Washington, Michigan. After taking credit for Hispanic unemployment numbers dropping, the president said this: "Any Hispanics in the room?" Trump asked to relative silence. "Naw, not so many? That's OK." Then he took a swerve into: "In all fairness, Kanye West gets it. He gets it." The president was referring to the rapper's recent show of support for him. Satisfied the audience was lacking in Hispanics, Trump launched into a tirade repeating his demand for his border wall, and said those illegally crossing into the U.S. are somehow voting for Democrats in elections. "All of these people pouring across are gonna vote Democrat," he claimed, even though studies have shown few undocumented people vote for anyone, Democrats or otherwise, except in the few places where their votes are specifically allowed. "They do it for a lot of reasons," Trump said. "A lot of times they don't even know what they're doing or why they're doing it, but we have to have borders and we need it fast." He threatened to "close down the country" if he doesn't get funding for his wall in next year's budget. Before Trump attempted to reach out to Hispanic voters in South Florida earlier this month, he employed a similar tactic of surveying the audience. "Are there any Hispanics in the room?" Trump asked during a roundtable discussion on tax cuts, The Washington Post reported. He didn't wait for an answer. "No, I doubt it," he said.
