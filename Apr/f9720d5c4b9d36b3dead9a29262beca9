My clients often ask what I eat to get through a busy day. You really can't go wrong with a bit of good organic chickenâ€”even better if it's left over from the night before! Throw it on a salad, or wrap it up in a tortilla with some spinach and I am good to go! #TastyTuesday #EatWellBeFabulous #TakeBackYourFabulous (Photo by @travisyewell on @unsplash) A post shared by  Wendy Ida (@wendyidafitness) on Mar 27, 2018 at 9:56am PDT   3.
