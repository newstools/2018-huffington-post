Cardi B has long had a reputation for being honest, real and hilarious ― and she lived up to it during a radio interview on Monday. The rapper opened up about her relationship with Offset, her former job as a stripper, her success as an artist and preparing to become a mom. There had been rumours for months that Cardi was expecting, but she kept the secret until last weekend's big reveal on "Saturday Night Live". Cardi told New York's Hot 97 she kept the big news to herself because she "really hated how people harassed me and didn't let me breathe". "I have given y'all so much," she added. The "Bodak Yellow" singer finally announced on "SNL" that she is pregnant with fiancé Offset's baby, just one day after releasing her debut album "Invasion Of Privacy". She later said in an Instagram story ― now deleted ― that a major reason she kept the news to herself was because of "haters". In the radio interview, she elaborated on that comment. Cardi sounded off on people criticising her pregnancy with questions like, "Why is she doing that in the height of her career?" by saying, "Why can't I have both?" Yes, Cardi. She continued: "Why do I have to be in my mid-30s to have a baby? What am I doing wrong? I'm a grown woman. ... I'm 25 years old, and I'm going to say this in the most humblest way, I'm a millionaire. I'm established." She said she has picked a name for her baby (but didn't disclose it) and said Offset will be a good father. Even if "God forbid" their romantic relationship doesn't work out, she and her child will be totally okay, she said. "My man is a great father to his kids. I will never lose. I'm not having a baby with a deadbeat," she said. Many people on social media showed undying support for Cardi's statements: Cardi B clocked all of y'all that had something to say about her getting pregnant 🗣🗣💯 pic.twitter.com/7s5MrGVgT1 "Why can't I have both?" Yass say that!!! I think people forget that women should be able to have a family while chasing their dreams! https://t.co/tIVjMjW9bd @iamcardib is just as human as everyone else, shes gotten so far and is continuing to go farther so what's wrong with that? https://t.co/LDffP415OQ 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Let my girl BE bruh ... Like she got a career so what's the problem ? Y'all hate to see someone be successful ... https://t.co/knkrenclci "Why can't I have both? Why do I have to choose a baby or a career? A family or a career?" This queen be hyping women up and I have nothing but respect for this boss lady 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 https://t.co/GZuB916Wsi I'm with it, nothing is impossible. Strong independent women raise children on their own and do an amazing job, they still persevere. She's got a career, a fiancé, and money, why y'all expect any less from her? https://t.co/lTuWmA0S10 Why'd this make me tear up?? Like she's just a young girl trying to live her life & if she wants a baby, she can have a baby. She's so realistic about it too. Ugh, so much love to Cardi. https://t.co/m5YOPRKPd1  Share this slide:
